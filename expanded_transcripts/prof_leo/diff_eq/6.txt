Transcript for: Differential Equations with Velocity and Acceleration (Differential Equations 7)
hey there let's get going another idea actually an extension what we just did in the last video so now that we've talked about the most basic differential equations and how to find a solution to them through integration let's go step further what if we had a second-order differential equation so something with the second derivative could we do the same idea here's a second derivative of some function y equal to a function of X with no variable Y in them so what we're going to learn this lesson is that this is possible if we just have X's over here we can just do two integrations so back-to-back to get to our function y that works really well we're going to find out that works really well with acceleration velocity and position because the derivative of position is velocity and the second derivative position is acceleration so we can model a lot of those situations with something very practical very simple like we've had here let's see how it works and then we're going to do just a few examples again our feet wet and then next video I'm gonna crush some examples I'm gonna just have so many it's gonna be a really long video and watch it just for the the sake of man it's gonna help you not only learn this stuff but get a real real good feel for what's going on in differential equations as far as positions concerned so we'll do some cool examples in the next video right now though we have a second derivative equal to a function of X let's start by taking an integral like we we did in the last section and let's see what happens if we take and integrate both sides what we're gonna end up getting is a first derivative of Y with respect to x equals well some integral of that function of X so we've integrated both sides we have a first derivative equal to the integral if you integrate both sides we haven't done anything with this side yet well let's think about it what we would end up getting is some sort of an antiderivative with a plus C we talked about that last section that when we do an integral we have a plus C that's a family of curves here's the second part I was talking about I kind of just glossed over in the last video but well over the last few videos if you have a second order differential equation sure an integral is gonna work you're gonna do plus C but what if we have to take another integral so if we do this again take an integral both sides what starts happening is that we have this integral of G of X plus C that this is a integral of an antiderivative already but because we've been separate integrals by addition and subtraction we also have the integral of this constant that we just found so we have a second derivative we take an integral we get a first derivative equals some integral some antiderivative the antiderivative can have a plus C if we do another integral this plus C gets integrated which means that that plus C I'm going to leave this by the way as an integral of G of X because I don't have a more capital letter than capital T so this would be a stand for the antiderivative but if I integrate that plus C that we just got we are going to get AC with an X on it so we have that arbitrary constant but now we're tacking on an X and we're going to get another constant out of it so when we integrate twice we get two arbitrary constants and if you remember from one of the first videos every time you have a higher order of differential equation you're going to get another arbitrary constant for this reason so we have a second order you can expect two arbitrary constants what that means practically for us if this is the first one and this is the second one if you want a particular solution this is still a general fan of family of curves general solution is still family of curves but if you want a particular solution you can't do it with just one initial value anymore there's two arbitrary constants you'll need two pieces of information such as let's say that you you want to find out the position of something well you'll need an initial position you'll also need an initial velocity if you start with acceleration acceleration is a second derivative so if I start undoing a second derivative I'm gonna get first derivative velocity I'll need an initial velocity or find that plus C by undo that with an integral I get the original position function I'm going to need that initial velocity for the first derivative ever sorry for the first derivative but after the first integration but I'll need an initial position for the position function to satisfy the two arbitrary constants so let me let me recap this a little bit there's a lot of words in a short amount of time can we do the same idea the second derivative of course if we have a second derivative equal to some function of X and in differential equations start integrating every time you integrate though you're going to be 2 plus C so we have to integrate twice we end up getting two different plus C's Y you just integrate the first arbitrary constant again that gives you a CX and then you tack on a plus C to that what I was saying about the initial conditions here is that right here would be your first right that's yeah let's say right here right here would be your first different first first-order difference equation it has a plus C and it would require an initial condition to satisfy that to solve ax plus C when we do it again we'll need a different initial condition to soften that plus C so link two of them so we're gonna do right now is we're gonna look at look at some acceleration velocity and position functions so if X is a position with respect to time so our position is given as a function of of time well then our velocity is just a first derivative so if X is our position with respect to time then our velocity is simply the derivative of X with respect to time that that's what velocity as velocity as held position is changing oh my gosh that makes sense in differential equation velocity is how position X is position it's changing with respect to time how it's moving that that's basically it so we have this ya velocity is the first derivative the strength of time of our position or if you want to make it a little different velocity is the first derivative that that should make sense we've seen that before well if velocity is the way that position is changing acceleration is the way that velocity is changing so acceleration is the rate of change of velocity that means it's a derivative of velocity so acceleration is a derivative of velocity with respect to time position with respect to time let's call it a function of T this is given us our where our position is how our position is changing the rate of change of our position is called velocity that's kind of the first derivative the rate of change of velocity is called acceleration it's got to be the first derivative of velocity or a second derivative of position position is a function of time velocity is the first derivative acceleration is the second derivative it's kind of plain simple we've seen that before but now we're going to use it a little bit more than maybe you have in the past let's start with the start deceleration and let's see just just what happens so if acceleration is constant so we're going to assume that it is for this case if acceleration is constant the derivative of velocity with respect to time would be acceleration so the rate of change of velocity is acceleration let's go ahead let's do this part right here let's let's see how to give some some different functions by just doing some integrals if the derivative of velocity with respect to time the rate of change of velocity times is equal to acceleration and we integrate both sides with respect to time do do you see I hope that hope that you see do you see that if this is a constant right here that's a constant we can do exactly the same thing we did in last video that last lesson and we can separate that DT over if it's not a constant yeah baby question I give it a little water it's not a constant well then it's a function of T and you can still do it so a velocity if the derivative lost their strength time that's acceleration is a function of time you still do this it's just not as simple and we'll do some of those samples in just a minute I won't leave you hanging but if acceleration is a constant this is very easy we just move our our DT over we take an integral we get a velocity is acceleration times time do you see it that's a constant if that's a constant all you got to do is say oh that's like three three et would be already enrolled but we give this 1 plus C I'm gonna put C 1 because I know that dealing with second derivatives like acceleration we're gonna get to seas in order to solve this though so if we have the velocity I'm going to put a respect with velocity of time here if we have that in order to solve that see one we see someone we need an initial condition in other words we need the initial velocity to solve this this is what I was preface seeing when I was talking about this stuff so we have these these two arbitrary constants that we're gonna have in order to find out a particular solution you're gonna need two pieces of information so I'm gonna go through this one more time because it's crucial that you understand what's going on we have position the first derivative is velocity the second derivative the acceleration if we start with acceleration we can work backwards just like we did here here the second derivative treat this like acceleration we took an integral okay that's now velocity but that velocity has a plus C you need the initial velocity very good at plus C initial because we need to know what the velocity was at time zero Y times zero times zero so that it cancels out all the t's so that we can actually solve for C that's most of the time what we absolutely have to have so when we say this we need a an initial velocity we need the velocity at time zero most of the time we call this a V Sub Zero just treat that like initial velocity that would be the velocity at starting time so whenever you started looking at the situation that's how fast it was going so you know you launch a rocket off the top of a building and then it fizzled out the initial velocity is important to us what was how fast was it going we started setting up learn modeling the situation well if we have that notice what it takes notice what that is there is important it says the velocity at time zero is V sub 0 the velocity at time zero so whatever a is constant at time zero that's gonna go away plus c1 equals the initial velocity let's say like 20 feet per second or 50 or negative 33% you throwing it down towards earth that that's important for us to find that so when we're given a second derivative like acceleration is yes we can get to a first derivative with an integral but you're gonna need an arbitrary where you're going to need a piece of information to get rid of that arbitrary constant you're going to need an initial value which we have let's say that's initial value is the V of 0 equals V sub 0 the initial velocity well and just like before in last video c1 would equal the initial velocity this is interesting so our velocity our velocity is equal to just think logically about it it should make sense our velocity is equal to how fast you're starting plus how much accelerations of making it with respect to time how is it increasing speed or decreasing speed once it howls of doing that that that should make sense we can start somewhere and then you're adding subtracting velocity to that and so the acceleration is how that velocity is changing so we started with the second derivative acceleration we undid it with an integral now we have a first derivative of position if we just do one more integral so velocity is the first derivative of position if we just do one more integral position is the integral of velocity so velocity is the first derivative of position therefore if we integrate with velocity we are in a position back here for a second so let's do that so our position is going to equal the integral of whatever we just found is our velocity that's right here so notice what happens initial velocity is a constant so that's like a starting speed velocity that's a starting velocity so it's not going to be based on any variable T we assumed a was a constant but even if it wasn't you can still do this because it's going to be based on to you as well so our position function is we do have to integrate that T we do get a tack on T here and then we're gonna get another constant this is what I was talking about in order to get rid of your arbitrary constants you did an initial value for initial condition for each one of them so we need an initial velocity when we dealt with a velocity we're gonna need an initial position when we deal with position so we start integrating acceleration you get velocity to get rid of that arbitrary constant you're gonna need an issue velocity we didn't read that again we get position to get rid of that new arbitrary constant we're gonna need initial position so we're gonna have to have that somewhere by the same logic you're gonna know where you start so at time zero where are you how high are you above the ground weird how far are you from a starting point point or ending point so the position at time zero let's call it X sub zero let's plug that in and again by the way I mentioned before but it's really to have that zero here because that zero is going to zero out all of your times I forgot something I hope you see it look right now if you didn't if you know if you don't see it I miss something here is a big deal it's a real big deal because I screwed it up this looks good and one add one to that power one you get to get 1/2 I forgot the T I said it I just was talking too much I'm didn't do it that zero is important because it's going to zero out the Tim T's and allow you to solve for C sub two so the position at time zero is X sub zero all that's gone and we get that C sub two equals next sub zero if we put this back together now we have an initial position based on whatever acceleration we were given now what I'm really hoping is it this looks familiar to you I'm gonna do a short recap is to make sure we're on the same page and then I'll start talking about why that should look familiar so blessed last lesson we had this idea that if you have a first derivative and you have a function of X on one side or a function of an independent variable the independent variable on one side you can just integrate you can also do that with second derivatives you just have to integrate twice but when you do that you get one two arbitrary constants those two arbitrary constants require one two initial conditions to get both of them let's say solve or to find both of them so when we're dealing with acceleration velocity and position which is modeled really well by this we take an integral to get from acceleration to velocity we need initial velocity to get rid of a plus C we take another integral to go from full city to position the initial position to get rid of that second plus seen C sub two now the reason why I say that should look familiar is because you see this all the time in classes like an intermediate algebra where you teach you go to a hey you're looking at people below and you also water-balloon because it's that person I am how long is it going to take to hit the ground or stuff like that and you go well that looks like that looks like this why is it look like that well the real story would be you're standing on top of a 225 foot building what's your initial position oh my gosh your initial position is 225 feet above the ground plus 225 that's where that comes from you throw the water balloon down at 20 feet per second your initial velocity is thrown down at 23 per second what in the world is this from where's the negative 16 acceleration on this planet is negative 32 feet per second squared it's going stuff drops in negative 32 feet per second squared one half of that is negative 16 so where this comes from is actually differential equations so where you where we got all those really weird formulas and intermediate algebra with stuff like that so can you can you go straight from here plug it in here and get something usable yes if your acceleration is constant if your generation is not constant then you basically have to go through this whole process take the integral of acceleration it's gonna be based on T it's not gonna be a problem don't worry about it take any integral of acceleration it's a function find the initial velocity plug it in do it again find the position find the initial position the position function find initial position should plug it in you're done so it's not all that bad but if you have constant acceleration like we have right here this is acceleration is negative 20 could you go through the whole thing and just like we did yeah you could could you just plug in here yeah he could and of course I'm me I'm show you both ways so I want to show you that if your acceleration is constant this is really really usable for you if it's not we go through the same process so it's useful for you to see it both ways let's start with acceleration I'm gonna walk through all this one time for you to make sure you get our velocity velocity is equal to the integral of acceleration because of that the derivative of velocity with space times acceleration so if we want to find velocity itself we would integrate both sides and that's exactly what we're getting that from so we're just we're just thinking backwards if we integrate that well we have a specific acceleration don't we it's it's it's some function of time in this case of the constant function says you're just going to integrate negative 20 so acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity if we integrate acceleration therefore we get velocity when we do that integral we get negative 20 t-shirt but we get an arbitrary constant this is where the initial velocity has to come in you've got to know where you start so this is going to be given by V sub 0 alot if it's not given by V sub 0 it's going to be given by something like the velocity at time 0 is negative 15 this is saying the same exact things no different that always allows us to solve for c1 never see someone that that's really cool so the velocity at time 0 is negative 15 the time is 0 is when you start can you see that darn near every single time you were just going to get plus C equals initial velocity with this situation it's gonna happen every time so if we modify this I'm going to race everything but this is all I really need you to see it the very end then we get that our velocity function is negative 20 minus 15 but wait there's more we also know that the first derivative of position is velocity well what that means is that if we move our D team we take an integral all we have to do is integrate velocity and we're going to find our position function that's great let's do it so our position function is equal to the integral of velocity we know velocity the velocity is given by this negative 20 t minus 15 DT when we integrate that we're going to give let's see negative 20 T just add 1/2 that be negative 10 T squared minus 15 T we're integrating we're always adding a T to those those constants but we're gonna get another arbitrary constant this is where the initial position has to come in this is yeah you're going to know where you start to figure out what that plus C is but it's almost always 99% I'm just going to be that it's gonna be the number it's gonna be 5 so if X of 0 is 5 or X of 0 equals 5 it says our position is 5 5 feet high or if you're dealing with when your time is 0 that's 0 and that's 0 can you see that almost every time I hope you can see that almost every time that see one's gonna be fine if your T's gonna be gone you're just gonna get that initial position and if we rewrite this we get negative 10 T squared minus 15 T plus 5 now check this out could you just look here take this stuff put it there and get that the answers yes if if your acceleration is constant if it's not constant and you can't do that so if you have non constant acceleration you have to basically go through the whole process I'm gonna show you in just a minute I'll give you three examples we'll go through them go from kind of easier to harder none of them are very hard as long as you know how to integrate let's do but check it out if you plug in your acceleration of negative 20 half of negative 20 is negative 10 T squared velocity initial velocity of -15 okay - 15 initial position 500 plus y it's the same same thing if acceleration is constant I'm gonna race the board I'm going to come back with those three examples and walk through them and see how to do this from scratch if you don't have constant acceleration again if you don't have constant acceleration you can't just plug in play with this stuff we have to we typically have to integrate twice it's not hard you just need to make sure that for every arbitrary constant you're given or that you get you are also given an initial condition so you'll be initial velocity and you'll need an initial position all right so I've got three examples up here we're gonna walk through all three of them these are the wind accelerations not constant obviously we have some T's we're so is given to us so we're gonna have acceleration changing as far as time is concerned that's fine it doesn't make things all that harder it's just that you generally can't just plug this into that last equation I gave you but it gives are the same acceleration is the derivative of velocity or the second derivative of position so we're just gonna be taking two integrals the first integral is going to give us velocity plug in your initial velocity the second integral is going to give you a position plug in your in this missile position and there with these two pieces information you're able to get rid of those two arbitrary constants let's go through them let's give them a try that's about it so first thing we know that acceleration is the first derivative of velocity so if we want to find velocity we're gonna integrate acceleration so when we integrate 2 T plus 1 begin T squared plus T plus c1 this is where initial velocity comes in you got to make sure that you know that at time 0 we have negative 7 remember when I said that almost always this c1 is going to end up being initial velocity when you integrate one time so acceleration of velocity be looking out for that is going to be here now that we have this initially this this velocity function we know that velocity is the first derivative of position let's just integrate velocity and then get our position function so when we do that we get 1/3 T cubed minus 1/2 T squared minus 70 but then we have our second arbitrary constant again you're you're given an initial position you have to be able to find this c1 that initial position is on time 0 that means that every place you have a teen if you have a polynomial you're gonna get zeros so zero zero zero your c1 is going to be four so then your position is 4 when your time is zero so all that's left is C 1 C sub 1 so we get our position function by 1/3 T cubed plus 1/2 degree of n plus 1/2 T squared minus 17 in this case plus 4 remember we're doing these are differential equations this right now is a particular solution that satisfies both of these conditions that's what at 18 both conditions to find that particular solution now it's kind of cool let's do a couple more so next example we have our acceleration is is depending on one over the square root of t plus 4th where we're given acceleration let's find velocity by a first derivative since we can write that the square root of t plus boards on the denominator that's in its a 1/2 power on the denominator so this can be rewritten as t plus 4 to the negative 1/2 power why we're doing that we're going to a substitution here in just a minute U is going to equal T plus 4 I mentioned last time if you really need to do u equals T plus 4 that's fine and do D u equals DT that's that's cool but for stuff that doesn't have any constants coming out from that derivative or coefficients or anything like that you really don't absolutely need to just cover this up pretend that's you when we get you to the positive one path over 1/2 so if you think about that like ok that's you then because this D u equals DT it's a direct substitution we just cover up and think that we go ok this would be U to the one half T plus 4 and 1/2 over 1/2 that's going to give us 2 but we are going to get a plus C 1 well thankfully we're given an initial velocity we can plug that in right now don't wait don't wait till later don't integrate right now and get a C 1 T and plug both in that's you can do that but it's a lot easier just to go step by step so we know that at time 0 our initial velocity is negative 1 so our initial velocity here negative 1 when time is 0 now we're gonna run into a case where our seat 1 is not just our initial velocity anymore and that's that's fine it is if you have basic polynomials like we had before like I was talking about in the previous little examples that we did but then we started getting there some things like like this one where we go okay well this this doesn't zero out here we have a composition of functions when we started a lot of times in that it's not a basic polynomial your C one isn't going to do that matricide when it is you're good to go but then we start doing with some more advanced stuff and you gotta plug in your initial velocity to find your c sub 1 so 4 plus 0 is 4 square root of that is 2 2 times 2 gives us 4 so our C 1 is negative 5 let's rewrite that so we're gonna have 2 times T plus 4 the 1/2 minus 5 let's keep on going so we have that minus 5 in there all we got to do now we got we got our velocity function let's take another integral let's go from velocity to position just so now we have a minus 5 at the very end that's upon position is the integral velocity because velocity is the first derivative of position and if we do this correctly we should begin same idea you can do a you sub that's fine but if you just ignore that the derivative of this is one you're it's a direct substitution with D U and DT so we're gonna pretend that's you we would get you to the add one to that you three-halves we still have a two hanging on divided by our new exponent is three-halves minus 5t we're integrating that v plus our second arbitrary constant and we do a little bit of manipulation here those twos don't cancel they becomes four thirds now we get to look at our initial position that's all what's it what it's going to take to get rid of that second arbitrary constant it says that we're at time zero or at position one or one unit away from wherever we started so I'm going up here so one is what we get when our time is zero well let's think through this so this is for the square root of 4 is 2 to the third power is 8 8 times 4 is 32 or 3 that's nasty minus 0 plus C 2 so if we subtract that from both sides what negative 20 negative 29 over 3 this is 3rd 3 thirds minus 30 2/3 native 29 thirds if we put that all that together we have our position function now now remember what we're trying to do what differential equations does it gets back to the original function that when you take a derivative of it it gives you bilasa t and when you take a second derivative it gives you acceleration and it satisfies these two conditions that's what you're doing if you haven't done it already I would really encourage you to pause the video right now just try that one see if you can do it see if you can remember how to do integrals of signs and things like that it's not beyond you you can certainly do it be careful of that little substitution right there dividing by 5 but you can certainly do that I would strongly encourage you to pause right now make sure that you can do that and that stuff I unfortunately need to continue so hopefully you got this down let's work on that so we have acceleration again we're going to take two integrals here one to get back velocity the second one to get back position we just have to plug in our initial conditions as we go so we know maybe it kind of quick velocity is going to be the integral of acceleration if we do that we keep that 50 that's a constant the integral of sine is negative cosine so remember that the derivative of sine is cosine integral of sine is negative cosine so we're gonna get negative from that integral of sine being negative cosine we have a 50 will have a cosine of 5t but we would have au sub in here your little you then probably going right down it is 5t the derivative is d u equals 5 dt or d u over 5 equals DT you're going to be dividing by 5 and we need an arbitrary constant now let's simplify it just a little bit and we're ready for initial velocity which says that at time of 0 we have negative 10 cosine 0 just as there is 1 so this is negative 10 equals negative 10 plus c1 well therefore binghamton equals main temple c1 c1 0 it's nice so our velocity function changes to right here just note C 1 is 0 and less thing we now have our velocity that's great let's just do one more integral we get back to our position and then that will solve our differential equation and let us have a function that has this as an acceleration function and meets both of those initial conditions so position is integral of velocity we got that down let's just do one more integral the integral of cosine is sine so we're going to keep the negative 10 we're going to get a positive sign and then we're going to get that 5t but we'll be divided by the derivative again now we get another constant let's simplify it at this point I hope you know what I'm doing I'm not just trying to crush you with examples of I'm trying to give you different hey do you remember how to do these integrals problems so I'm sort of trying to review with you if for those of you needed as we're learning this material because frankly these are all three of the same exact half the problem you do integral like a number get again very good but remembering sine cosine some little substitutions things like that's important so we now have our position function but we need an initial position to get rid of that arbitrary constant we know that at x 0 we have x equals 8 well 5 times zero is zero sine of zero is zero 2 times zero or native 2 times zero is zero C 2 is 8 put this all back together we get a really nice position function where if you took the derivative of this it is going to be that if you take the derivative of this it is going to be that and if you plug in these numbers it satisfies both of these these equations so they'll all fly straight backwards these equations satisfy both those initial conditions that's what we're dealing with here just a small application of how we deal with some of these differential equations involving acceleration velocity and position again it's it's it's all about at this point can you get a derivative on one side first second third whatever and a function of X on the other if you have that start integrating it just so happens though that for every higher order of derivative you have you need another initial condition so for first-order you know one initial condition second order to third or extrapolating there I hope that's making sense to you next time what we're gonna do actually do a ton of examples about cars skidding and jumping on plans of different gravity and how this stuff plays out on some I don't know life examples so you get some word problems under a belt to make sure that we're understanding it so I'll see you for the next video you
