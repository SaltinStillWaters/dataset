Transcript for: Equilibrium Solutions and Stability of Differential Equations (Differential Equations 36)
hey welcome to another video I hope that you are ready to start wrapping up this stuff about population modeling because we only have about three more videos this one and two more and then we're going to move on to acceleration and some oscillation type problems so in order to wrap this up we're going to talk about how you know when something is going to go to a number as far as a population or explode and so we're going to talk about something called equilibrium Solutions we'll talk about critical points we'll talk about stability funnels spouts and then we'll move on and talk about harvesting and and stocking populations in another video so today's video I really want to get the point across to as as to how you would know when our population is going to explode or go to a number when you're not based on something like the logistic equation or an explosion Extinction model when we're not we can't immediately see that and so we're going to discuss that in this video today so let's get right to it let's look at a differential equation like uh the derivative of s x with respect to time is x - 4 now here's the premise to this question what if your initial let's say this is a population of X so maybe X is our population with respect to time what if your initial population or your initial x value was was four well what would what would that do because if you plug in a four right there four - 4 is is zero wait a second if 4 - 4 is z that means that the way you're X changes with respect to time would be zero there would be zero change that's the the the way that our population would be changed with respective time wouldn't change our population of X or whatever X is would not be changing in in general if our derivative with respect of time is zero then obviously nothing would change here the rate of change is zero nothing's changing when that happens so when you have this value this point like four in this case or whatever is making your derivative zero just like in calculus one we call that a critical point do you remember that when you took a first derivative and you set it equal to zero and you said he where this where the slope changes from positive to negative we we have this horizontal tangent you go the slope is zero when the first derivative is equal to zero we have what's called a critical point and lots of important things happen at critical points same thing here if we have a a model the way that something change with respect to time and if this equals z at any point we gain what's called a critical point we have a critical point here so in specifically xal 4 is called a critical point often times we'll also hear it called an equilibrium solution and why that is if you have an initial value of four so X Sub 0 equals 4 and you plug that in here you can't possibly get a change from your population if we're going to call this population or your X function if you want to call it that there will be no change it will stay the same forever and ever and ever and ever so if we start exactly at four there's going to hold this equilibrium nothing will change from that you can't gain you can't lose it's going to be at a no change a zero sum sort of an equation so one one time just to recap this one with our differential equations I'm trying to teach you when we will stay at the same level when we will explode when we will go to a carrying capacity or vice versa become extinct or come to a eliminate population or when we're going to stay the same I'm I'm going to talk about that to start there anytime your derivative is zero you have what's called a critical point we know that from calculus one here what that's going to mean is that if you start at that critical point exactly then you would have a change in your population whatever your function is of zero your rate of change is zero it cannot change that solution of the critical point is often times called an equilibrium solution because you are at equilibrium nothing's gaining nothing's losing so an equilibrium solution so how do we find them just like in calculus one it's a very simple idea because your dxdt is a derivative that's fantastic this is a derivative so if our DX DT our derivative of x with respect to time is some function of X which that's what we have here if that's some function of X then where your derivative equals zero man see this where your derivative this is the derivative where your derivative is equal zero it's going to give you these critical points so running through this if you want to find critical points all you got to do is set your function equal to zero because that function is the derivative here and critical points are found by setting your first derivative equal to zero so we're going to set our first derivative our function of X which is our differential equation we're going to set it equal to zero that's going to give us critical points so let's consider a critical point like xal c a critical point we just went through it but if x sub Z if your initial X is the critical point itself we call that an equilibrium solution nothing's going to change our derivative would be zero you can't gain you can't lose we are horizontal right there so this would be an equilibrium solution yeah I suppose that's not all that exciting it kind of makes sense right so if you if you got a derivative of x with respect to time and and you know that's your derivative your first derivative of some function and you say hey uh I plug in some number that's going to make it zero obviously we're not changing from that that's that's not a a a hugely surprising thing we're going to stay at the same level forever because the Der of zero says we can't increase we can't decrease our population stays the same or whatever your function of X is stays the same forever the interesting things happen when your initial condition is above or below that critical point so let's talk about what happen if our initial condition is greater than C or less than C some interesting things are going to happen so wait wait a second if our initial condition is greater than C then really only two things could possibly happen now I'm not talking specifically about this one differential equation but in general here's what could happen if we start here's our here's our critical point if we start above that then only two things could happen either we explode forever or we shrink to C if we start below that c we either gain to C or we become extinct or go to some lower critical point so we're either getting two or away from that that critical point that should kind of make sense there's only two ways to go if you got a critical point you start at it you're not going to change because your derivative would be zero it's an equilibrium solution if we start above it we will either explode or we will shrink to C if you start below it you're either going to gain to C or you're going to fall or go away from C if you want to kind of spout out of that or drop to a lower critical point or go extinct so if we have a initial condition greater than C we will either explode or Shrink to that c what if it's less than C well we can either gain to C or we can become extinct if this is the only critical point these are the only outcomes so just to make sure we got that derivatives mean rate of change obviously so if we set our first derivative equal to zero we have what a call critical points and if we have an initial condition that is that critical point nothing's going to change slope would be zero function can't change you have an equilibrium solution the interesting thing happens when our initial condition is above or below that critical point if we're above we're either going to become extinct or Shrink to that critical point if we're below we're either going to gain to that critical point or become extinct question is how which one's which and what's beautiful about this because that's a first DED because it represents the rate of change we can do the first derivative test or a sign analysis test or just look what the slope is doing and it will tell us exactly what's happening around those critical points so if our first derivative is this function that we're talking about so this is a derivative I know looks a little different than the first derivative test from calcul this one because there's no Prime but keep in mind this is the first derivative of some function x what we're going to do is we're going to Simply put our critical points on a number line and do sort of a modified sign analysis test so we'll look at this and just plug in a number plug in something greater than C and see what your function is doing see what your first derivative is doing and there's really four cases so sign analysis test first derivative test whatever it is there's really only four cases if we plug in a number greater than C and we get a negative and we plug in a number less than C to our first driven right here and we get a positive what's happening is that our function would be decreasing if we have an initial condition greater than C it will be decreasing but but if we have an initial condition less than C our function would be increasing right there we have what is called a stable critical point what that means is that around that critical point in the neighborhood around that that you would have numbers whether you're less than or greater than you're going to ultimately go to that critical point that's called stability or that's a a stable critical point so if we start above it it's going to drop to it if we start below it it's going to gain to it this is what we call stable and how would it look I'm going to draw that right here how would St table look if we have an initial condition less than our critical point so down here somewhere this says that we would be gaining so we'd say okay so you're testing this you're you're looking your first derivative you found your critical points you have them on some sort of a sign analysis or number line plug in a number less than that and you get a positive plug in a number less than that and you get a positive wait a minute positive positive slope the function is increasing we would get something that looks like this well wait a minute if you plug in something higher you have a negative negative means negative slope means your function is decreasing we would get something that looks like this soor it's kind of messy but we have this kind of convergence both of our our sides here so we have a a stable critical point if we have both whether we're positive or negative above or below that critical point we end up getting to it like an ASM toote right there what you call that is a funnel so everything's funneling to that number of C that's what stable means that's what the picture would look like so what are the other options well uh what if you had this critical point and you plug in a number greater than that and you get a positive so that means me that let's see if we plug a number greater than our critical point we got a positive that that means increasing so positive slope means increasing U that would be a function going away from that critical point gaining away from it remember you're above it and you're increasing or what if we plugged in a number less than our critical point to our first derivative and we got we got a negative well that would be decreasing that's away from that critical point that situ situation right there is called unstable an unstable critical point is where your function tends to go away from that number it's like it's fleeing the scene all right this is like gravity this is like I'm the stable means I'm going to I'm going to go right to it no matter what unstable means I'm going to go away from it no matter what and you can see it right here if you have a if you got some number that's starting above your C and you find out that the first deriva is positive that means that you are increasing now you're going to gain away from that number you're going to get something something that looks like this or below so if we have something that's negative we plug in a number less than our critical point in first Der we get something negative then for every initial condition less than that critical point we would have a negative slope negative slope means function is decreasing so I'm starting here and it's decreasing that's going to look like this that is what we call an unstable critical point and a lot of people refer to that as a spout so spout says I'm going away from it kind of U going out from funnel means going into spout means going out from this particular critical point I hope this is making sense I hope that you're seeing the relationship I hope made it very clear that what an equilibrium solution really means is that your slope's not changing if your slope's not CH if your slope is zero um if your slope is zero that means your function can't change if your slope is positive your function is increasing if your slope is negative your function is decreasing and then compared to our critical point how that interacts how your slope interacts around your critical point will tell you whether you have what's called a stable critical point or a funnel or unstable critical point or a spell going to or going away from that critical point in a neighborhood around it the other two conditions are called semi-stable and let's take a look at it for a second what if you plug in a number greater than your C and you get a plus and you plug in a number less than you see and you get a plus oh wait a minute what's that mean what's that mean uh slope would be positive so we would be increasing slope would be positive so it' be increasing that seems really weird this is called a semi-stable critical point because if we start below our C initial condition below C we're going to have a posi so we will be increasing we're going to get to that c eventually so we're going to look like this so it looks something like that but if we're above that c we're going to be also increasing so it's kind of a a a half funnel for those values below and a half spout for those values above this would be increasing still so we start above C we have a positive slope that'd be increasing still we'd get something that looks like this and so we have this below C you'd get to it above C you'd leave it that's called semi-stable likewise what if you plugged in a value above C and Below C got negative that means that we'd have a negative so that means our function be decreasing in both of these cases well it's still semi-stable but it look a little bit different for those values above C you'd have a negative slope the function would decrease but it would decrease until you get to C so it's going to look like this that middle one's a little funky sorry so it's going to decrease until you get there but if you have something below C some initial condition below that critical point you're still decreasing the function still dropping so you'd have this same sort of idea where you have a a sort of a both a funnel and spout in the same idea for those values initial condition starting above C you'd be dropping to it for those below C you'd be going to Extinction now I do want to say one thing about this this is for only one critical point so in the future when we have one or two or three critical points which we're going to see at some points you could have another critical point up here in which case this would gain and then get to it so around this one critical point we talk about whether we're leaving it or getting to it that's sort of the idea here so I'm only showing you one critical point but keep in mind if I've got another one I could leave from one critical point and drop to another that's perfectly acceptable or but it is my lowest critical point if I leave it if if I'm below it and I leave it if I spout out of it I'd be going to Extinction if I have my highest critical point and I leave it I'm going to be going to explosion I hope that makes sense I hope I've made it very clear um the interplay between critical points and this funnel spout the stable unstable and semi-stable cases these are both called semi-stable what I'm going to do now is I'm going to come back up here and we're just going to walk through this I'm going to leave this on the board we're going to see what case this actually is so what we talked about so far is that a first derivative is a slope when you set a first derivative equal to zero you get critical points and now we're using this in terms of our population or our modeling situations to say what's the graph going to do around there if that's a differential equation what would the function look like well it would depend on our initial condition and that's exactly what we're saying if our initial condition is four we have just this equilibrium solution if our initial condition is above my critical point I'm going to be in SE one of several cases I'm either going to drop to it or leave it leave it or drop to it depending on what my first dtive is actually doing same thing for our initial conditions less than C so we're looking at this saying it is a first derivative but since I don't know my parent function I'm kind of guessing at what it's going to look like and it's based on our initial condition what it's actually going to do hope this makes sense I'm going to come back up here and show you what this does okay so here we go now number one we'd say this right here is a differential equation it means a first derivative so if x - 4 = 0 then that's going to say our slope is zero that's called a critical point so we're going to say that x = 4 is our critical point what we do after that is we do what's called a sign analysis test or you can hear a phase diagram or a first derivative test all the same thing we're going to say our function r f ofx which is x - 4 right now is creating for us some sort of a a phase diagram based on a critical point of four so we just take our four you put on a number line and then we're going to plug in just like every first R test ever a number greater than four and a number less than four and see what our sign is I've given you a very simple case we'll deal with some much more advanced cases in this video but let's plug in a number like five if I plug in five to my first derivative remember our function is x - 4 I'm going to get a positive now I don't care that it's going to be one I care that it's positive so this would be a positive slope it says that we are increasing now now get this the slope is positive slope is not increasing the slope is linear you can see that the slope is just linear x - 4 here's what this says it says that because the slope is positive if I give it an initial condition greater than four my slope will be positive that family of Curves would be a family of Curves where all the slopes would be positive that means that the family of Curves all of them would be an increasing function again because this represents the slope I'm finding critical points if I plug in a number greater than that four it's that initial condition is more than four it's going to create for me positive slopes on a f or give me a family of curve that all has positive slopes and this this is coming from a family of Curves with positive slopes positive slopes means a family of Curves each one of which would be increasing just like this so five is more than four five is more than a critical point we are getting a family curves with positive slopes on that condition all of which would be increasing now plug in something like three or zero that'd be fine too 3 - 4 is NE 1 I don't care about the on so much I care that it's negative so so think about that if I give myself an initial condition of three or something less than my critical point like 3 2 1 Zer whatever that means that I'm getting a family of Curves here all of whom would have negative slopes that would be all decreasing all of these will be tracking away from that four think in your head is that stable or unstable we're going away from it it's it's spouting water it's going to get away from me this should be unstable in fact it's going to look like this that's exactly what we just said here you have a critical point C it's going to look like this at xal 4 if we start above it we are exploding if we start below it we are extincting if we start at it we stay the same there's no other critical point so so get this like this is the only critical point right it's the only place where our slope could equal zero that's it so if we start above that we are going to get a population explosion if this model's population or function explosion if we start below that we're going to get a population Extinction or function Extinction it's going to go to zero this has to make sense right now I hope I hope you've seen it are you seeing the stability versus instability or unstability um of this we we're using first we using the idea of slope we're saying positive means increasing negative means decreasing and showing where that is in relation to our critical point to determine whether we have a spout or a funnel stable versus unstable now can we go a little bit further and actually solve the differential equation well of course we can we're going to see why this is the way it is based on our differential equation so because we have some separable a separable equation here and we get our X's DXs and our constants DT and take this integral and exponent on both sides we've done this so many times I'm going qu kind of quick here and this whole thing is C and if we replace that with c replace that with with t do you remember this hope you remember as soon as you get that arbitrary constant especially when we have Ln now we're going to plug in an initial condition you go what do you mean an initial condition well let's just say that at X of Z you have some sort of an initial condition just use that use the x sub Z so that x sub Z is happening at time Z okay so e to the 0 power is 1 this C would equal x Sub 0 - 4 and if we plug that in so we have this x - 4 = x0 - 4 e t and just add our four and take a look at what this would do depending on what our initial I hope I didn't go too fast by the way this is just a separable difference of equation we're saying our initial condition is x sub 0 so when we solve for our C we have X Sub 0 when T is0 then C is x sub 0- 4 we've taken this plugged it in right there it's right there and we' just added four but look at what happens look how this is a vertical shift of four that means everything happens around that four this right here is this number so it's shifted up four units from the from x equals so from y equals z so four actually x equals z from four units up now take a look at this right here look what would happen if x sub Z is more than four if x0 is more than four you have a positive number a positive number times the exponential man e to the T it's the same exponential you know so if this is more than four you have a positive exponential it's going to grow that's exactly what that says it says uh you start at four and then add a function to it that is growing that is this now what if this is less than four if this number your initial condition is less than four then something less minus 4 would be something less than four minus 4 would be negative so you you start at four and say you'd subtra oh my gosh wait a minute e t that that would look like this CU it's a reflection across the um the yal Z line so x-axis so if this is negative remember e to the T some sort of negative e to the T it's not a dropping like this it's a reflection of your exponential so instead of climbing you'd reflect it youd be dropping that's what these say if your initial condition is less than four you have a negative exponential so go up to four and then do a negative exponential that's why this looks the way that it does this is just a really nice way to see it so like when we go through our next set of examples in the next video what's going to happen is I'm going to do a lot of them just by finding my critical points and making these graphs it's very nice for a few of them we're going to go all the way down and solve our differential equation and say do you see why this is do you see that that four is this critical point do you see that depending on depending on what your initial condition is we get a positive exponential if it's above four a positive exponential if it's below four a negative exponential it's going to spout away from that that's an unstable critical point this right now should be making a lot of sense to you I hope I've explain it well enough um obviously I think it's really cool so it's it's very interesting to me um that this stuff works and that you do your differential equation and models exactly what we saw with our first R of test so we're going to come back we're going to do one more example all the way through I'll explain the same things and then we'll be done all right so one more we're going to work our way through it I'm going to try not to go too fast to make sure that we we really really understand this but next time we're going to do a lot of examples too so right now I just need the overview of what's going to happen to be there we're going to get stability or unstability an unstable critical point um for each of these cases sometimes we can get semi we'll see that in next video how that looks but um what needs to be there right now is what how the first derivative differential equation is the first Der first order differential equation how that relates to increas and decreasing depending on your initial condition that is what is key is is that you understand that because we don't have the actual function X we have the derivative of that function that when we go back to it we're getting a family of Curves and that family of Curves is dependent on what our initial condition actually is that arbitrary constant it's so arbitrary if you have an initial condition is it because you solve for that and it says oh this is giving me a specific curve and where that specific curve is and how it behaves depends on that initial condition of X that's a big deal and we're seeing that in the course of our our graphing here we're seeing how that initial condition drastically changes what happens so let's go through it um we're noticing we got a first derivative differential equation SP of time and we have x 3 - x and we say well wait a minute so if we've got 3 - X and that's equal to the first derivative of our function then this itself that's a derivative and so we say we can find critical points all the time by setting our derivative equal to zero and solving so we have a critical point very easily of xal 3 now now get this not always if you're above the critical point do you gain you can't say that and so I I wanted to make that clear when I first introduced this concept in the first like 10 15 minutes but I really can't do it by looking at x - 4 because if we were above that we were gaining below that we were decreasing and you saw that on the first derivative but in general you can't make that statement you can't say every time I'm above a critical point I'm gaining that's not true because if I plug in a number like four I'm going to get a negative slope I'm decreasing that's that's why I said at the beginning that where our critical point is if you start above it you can either increase or Shrink to that critical point you start below it you can either increase to it or go away from that critical point it all depends on how your first derivative behaves that's why we have to do the S analysis test we can't just arbitrarily say oh you're above it you're going to climb forever that's not true right now we're sort of putting together the log the logistic with the EXP explosion Extinction ideas in a more general term here so when we look at this they go uh yeah our critical point is three let's go ahead take the time and do a first derivative test so our function is 3 - x we've got a critical point of three all that needs to happen right now since we do not have our function itself we just need to understand what our slope of our function is doing this is the slope of our function so if we start with a value greater than three like four 3 - 4 so our function here it's 3 - x if we start with four we're going to get we are understanding that for every value above three without exception there's only one critical point there's only one possible point where the sign of our function can change it's three every value of above that three is going to have a negative slope every single value initial condition above that is going to give you a family of Curves with negative slopes every Curve will have a negative slope every Curve will be decreasing get that I'm going say it again it's so important that there's only one critical point here there's only one number where our slope is going to change signs and that number is three every in every single initial condition greater than three is going to give you a curve remember this is a SL of a curve every initial condition greater than three is going to give you a curve that has a negative slope that means every single initial greater than three is going to give you a curve that is decreasing these are all going to be decreasing now do the same thing with a number less than your critical point like two or one or zero it doesn't really matter plug in two 3 - 2 is postive 1 so this is your slope all right this is your your slope it's not your function it's telling you that your initial condition is the the function you get is dependent on your initial condition so if I plug in a number less than three if I have an initial condition less than three what's that's saying is that that whole family of Curves every single initial condition less than three is going to give me a function whose slope this is slope is positive whose function is increasing that right there is giving us what's called called a stable critical point it is going to look just like this this is how this is going to look we're going to have some sort of a graph where the family of Curves depends on what your initial condition is if we have an initial condition that's greater than three we are going to get functions that are decreasing if we have initial conditions less than this we're going to get functions that are increasing we're going to get what's called a funnel things no matter where we start we're going to funnel into something near that one number as time goes on do you see it am I explaining well enough the interplay between the first derivative test what critical points are from like I don't know how many semesters ago that was um in into what your family of Curves has to be doing and the fact that it's based on your initial condition that's huge because in Cal one you sort of U sort of go backwards don't you you have a function and you take a derivative and then you say oh the function is doing this well here we're saying I have the derivative of the function what could the function be doing oh well that's that's a that's a different question what that means is that I'm doing my my first derivative test but I'm using it to model my function not the other way around not to to kind of gain my function not saying this is how the function looks but this is all the possible functions we would we would ever get and more than that it depends on where I start so if I'm starting above in this particular case I'm getting a family of curves that is all decreasing for every initial condition greater than three for every initial condition less than three I'm getting family curves all of whom are increasing and we put that together we have this final idea let's see how that plays out when we actually do our um our solving of our differential equation so You' seen me do a few different techniques and and give you a lot of different options over the last two three videos on how you structure these I've done things like factored out negatives when appropriate I've left them in there I've tried to give you a variety of ways to do it that way at least one of them are will stick in this case I'm I'm pulling out that negative and the reason why we we do that it's not super important I think I mentioned that many times is because when you start taking integrals I don't want you to take an integral of this and accidentally give me this oops because that's a problem you need a u sub and you'd get a negative so the reason why you'll see me do things like factor out a negative when it doesn't appear like it actually need to is just for that reason so in our case we have this Ln absolute value xus 3 we've got - t + C sub 1 we have an Ln we're going to wait to plug in our initial condition until we take that both sides as a exponent exponent on E we have x - 3 = this plus or minus E to the C sub 1 * e t we've done this many many times this right here is our constant but we also know that constants are always our arbitary constants are always found by an initial condition so what is our initial condition well we don't have a specific one remember what we're doing we're trying to be General we're trying to show the picture of our curves depending on our initial condition so when you get done with this you should be able to plug in any number and say hey for numbers greater than this number I'm going to explode or Shrink two for numbers less than number I'm going to well maybe come extinct or um gain two whatever that number is so we're going to use this initial condition to create a model of our general solution here whatever our initial condition happens to be let's plug it in when I plug in t = 0 I get X Sub 0 that gives us one so our c is x sub 0us 3 now when when we substitute that back in right here that's an x - 3 = x Sub 0 - 3 e to the T I'm going to take just a side step for a moment and I'm going to tell you on some of the harder examples that we're going to cover sometimes I will solve for C right now I'll I'll hold this off to the side but I'll leave the C in here and I'll solve this for x and then I'll plug the C back in because doing this on much more advanced examples can get really really really messy and so you'll see me go okay plug in plug in your initial condition now leave your seat just remember what that is solve for x and then plug in your c letter otherwise especially with fractions it gets it gets pretty crazy so I'm going to show you some of those techniques in the next video as well man we're almost done we're quite there so we have noticed that's a that's a slope this is the slope of every single function of x that whole family of Curves and we have determined that what that slope is the sign of that slope depends on a critical point where that slope equals zero is where your signs could change things above zero are positive below zero are negative so that critical point is is critical it tells us where our slope is positive and therefore increasing or negative and therefore decreasing and so what we've determined because that slope because that represents the slopes of every General the general solution or every family of curves that would have this as a slope we're saying saying that everything above that value of three is going to give us a family of curves that is decreasing every every value or sorry every initial condition less than three is going to give us a family of Curves who are increasing so we have a picture like this now let's make sure that what we've solved on our differential equation actually models this so we have the slope of the function right here guys this is the function this is every possible function that would have this as a slope this is your general solution solution and it's based on whatever your initial condition is now let's look that three hey that's a vertical shift that says that I'm going to have some important stuff happening at that horizontal ASM toote that equilibrium solution of xal 3 that's important if my initial condition is three I get a horizontal line now what if my initial condition is more than three more than three well three something more than 3 minus 3 would be positive but this is an exponential with a negative expon that looks like this those are droppies remember that e t looks like that wait that that's what this looks like so if I have an initial condition greater than three I will get positive positive decaying exponential just like it shows if I have something less than three I would get let's see again something less than three minus three that would be a negative a negative decaying exponential so a decaying exponential flipped over so wait a minute if I take a negative so remember this is negative negatives reflect about the xais it would look like this this would be e to the t e to the that's negative e to the t e to T is a decaying exponential e to the t almost looks like a logarithm here but it's not but it's a reflected decaying exponential it says that you're just taking this and flipping it over that's all it says it says that you're going to be looking just like this for every value starting less than three that's what this means this would be a stable critical point this is called a funnel it's exactly what we get right here which I I prised the last two I'm going to do in another video so when we get there um right now I I really would encourage you to go back through and try these two on your own they take maybe five minutes once you understand it it's not that that hard my job today was to explain to how the interplay the how this is slope and therefore represents a slope of some parent function some general equation some general solution and to show you that depending on your initial condition you're going to get a different type of curve something increases or decreases depending on what your initial condition is so I hope I've done a good job of that I hope I've explained and you should understand what U man it sounded like a lot when I first introduced it you should understand now what an equilibrium solution is something that makes your slope zero it's also called a critical point you should understand that depending on whether we are greater than or less than that critical point determines whether we have an unstable leaving or stable coming to that critical point or both leaving and coming to or coming to and leaving stable unstable and semi-stable cases so we've talked about equilibrium Solutions we've talked about stable versus unstable we've talked about funnels and spouts and I hope that I've shown you the interplay on how the differential equations actually show that but could you imagine could you imagine not actually doing this getting all the way down it's wouldn't it be hard for you to see that it would be hard for me to see that this looks exactly like that without this first so this is really important your first derivative test is huge it shows you what's actually going on around those critical points then your differential equation says oh yeah now that I know what that picture is I'm able to kind of see it so I hope that makes sense because this is what we're going to do for the last three examples in the next video I'm just going to show you the pictures of them because we'll have a very good interpretation of what's going on so I will see you for the next video when we talk about a few more examples and and kind of refresh around stability and unstability being stable and unstable spouse funnels and we'll talk about semi-stable have a great day I'll see you for that
