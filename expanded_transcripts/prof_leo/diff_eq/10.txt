Transcript for: Watch Before Diff Eq 11
hey everybody in the subsequent video I make an omission and I shouldn't have it in my mind I did it when I was filming it but I watched it back and it's not gonna make a whole lot of sense or it's gonna be very deceiving if you don't listen to what I'm about to tell you so we're going to talk about existence and uniqueness of solutions to differential equations at initial values and what I'm going to say many times in this video is that continuity does not exist at endpoints that is not true continuity of a function can exist at an end point if we consider one side of limits so when you're watching this video and I make those statements here's what I mean I don't say it and that is my fault but here's what I mean what I mean is that when we consider these points that were checking an initial value a point we need to consider continuity on an open interval around that point and that's due to differentiability since we're talking about differential equations so when I say that continuity does not exist at an endpoint here's what I meant to say here's what I mean to say here's what I've never made clear in the video and so I'm telling you right now so when I get there I say continuity does not exist the endpoint what I mean is if the initial value that we are checking happens at the endpoint of an interval of continuity if there's an endpoint there's not enough room for an open interval and neighborhood to be around it so this is then there's my mistake it did not make that very clear in the video so I'm telling you right now when I say that continuity doesn't exist at an endpoint what I mean is considering the initial value that we're checking that initial value cannot be an endpoint because there's not enough of a neighborhood to consider continuity so for this for this particular video continuity needs to be an open idea I say that many times but I never tell you it's only for this idea it's only for checking whether we have continuity around a point a neighborhood of a initial value that we are checking so one more time in the video you were about to watch I say many times company when you can't exist at an endpoint not true for functions in general but for the purposes of this video what we need this for continuity to be an open interval we need an open interval of continuity around the point we're checking and that means that for intervals of continuity if that point we're checking is at an endpoint we can't create that open interval so I hope that makes it clear again I apologize if the next part of the video just doesn't make sense come back and watch this again because continuity can exist endpoints with one-sided limits but for the purposes of differentiability and for the purposes of checking for existence and uniqueness we must have an open interval of continuity around the initial value that we're checking but what that means is that we cannot cannot let that initial value occur at an endpoint and that's what I mean by continuity does not exist at an endpoint is if that point that we're checking is an endpoint then we don't have an open interval of continuity around it I hope that makes sense enjoy the video and let me know if you get it
