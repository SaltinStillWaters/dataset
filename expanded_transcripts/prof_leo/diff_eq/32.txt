Transcript for: Basic Population Models in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 32)
hey welcome to another video so we've just explored what the logistic equation was we've explored what extinction and doomsday it looks like we've explored what bounded growth unbounded growth looks like for populations in other words we did a lot of theory and we were going to get to in the next videos how to work with that logistic equation and what sort of problems were modeled by it and how to work with explosion and extinction and populations but before we get there I thought it'd be really nice to give you some some introductory problems on how do you go about thinking of some of these setups because stuff like this isn't necessarily modeled exactly by the logistic equation it's this is not that that advanced but it's gonna step up to it so we have a real good feel with how population works hopefully now it's time to look at some real examples to get maybe an exploration on setting up some word problems again because sometimes it's really hard and so I'm going to show you how that works I'm going to do just two examples then next time we'll start looking at more of the logistic equation and then we'll talk about these these population explosions that we could have so and I'm gonna do that in the second example and covered they just think about what would happen a little bit later we'll see why why this is so let's look at one example let's say that there's a squirrel population and the the rate of change of the squirrel population is proportional to the square root of the population itself so what does that mean it means that the way that the population is changing is directly related to the square root of the population itself we're gonna look at how this affects the outcome of our problem remember that one thing we were very interested in the last video is is this population bounded or unbounded we'll start thinking about that as we go through at the time zero when you first start looking at there's a hundred squirrels and increase in its twenty squirrels a month that's a lot of squirrels how many squirrels were to be in one year so we're gonna diagnose exactly what this does so firstly the time rate of change of a squirrel population one the world is a time rate of change that is the rate of change of a population with respect to time so okay well if we make P the population than the rate of change of our population with respect to time let's see is proportional to when you hear that word proportional to that means that you have a constant being multiplied by some variable so if the rate of change of our population of the speck time is proportional to that's going to be constant times proportional to the square root not the square the square root of our population notice something this is a very stripped down problem there's nothing about how birth rates are changing there's nothing about how death rates are changing all this is giving you is some very basic information like okay the rate of change of population is proportional to the square root of our population but it's important it'll set these things up now the next statement says all right at time equals zero there are 100 squirrels and the population is increasing at a rate of 20 squirrels per month let's think about that for a second so the population at time 0 is 100 so the initial population is 100 squirrels but then this is really weird it's increasing at 20 squirrels per month well wait a minute we know that increase you think things that are increasing or decreasing things that are that they talk about a rate of change are talking about that derivative so when this is this is increasing at 20 squirrels per month well what's increasing with the population with respect to time whoa the bats talk about your derivative so this is saying the population is increasing with respect to time at a rate of 20 squirrels per month now this happens at a certain point so this is at time equals zero okay so writing we start we've got a hundred squirrels no problem I have under squirrels but we're also the population is also increasing at 20 schools per month so the first derivative population would speak to time the way that our population is changing with respect of time this is increasing at 20 so positive 20 schools per month when T equals zero here's what this means for us what this means is list some of these basic examples we can plug in everything and solve for that constant if you remember back to like the early days of Pompeii dealing populations the one of the big ideas was solving for that constant we did that with like half-life we did that with other sort of radioactive decay or population exclude increases exponentially is we wanted to find out what that constant of variation was so that that came out of words so one time all the way through we're either probably going all right the time rate of change is a derivative it's the way that the population is changing with respect to time we know that that's proportional to so a constant times the square root of population great let me give us some other information at time equals zero we have two things going on here we have that the initial population is 100 fantastic we also have that the change in population with respect to time is 20 that's at time zero what that means is that we can plug in the 20 and the 100 and we can solve for K right now so at time equals zero notice how this and this match up so they're both attainable zero we can say that at t equals zero our population with respect to time is changing at a rate of twenty squirrels per month and there are 100 squirrels present we're gonna get tables too so that's kind of nice because that's that lets us change this this original differential equation is something that doesn't have the arbitrary constant of that constant started concentration and one thing I want to mention right now this is the most basic example that I could find okay or come up with later on it's not gonna be that simple and so what we're gonna be doing is it's not always gonna give you this right there it's not always going to tell you the rate of change of your population straight the time right for that so when that happens you're gonna have that K in there for a while until we start integrating so now we go okay well okay our um our rate of change of population with respect to time is we have the constant of variation but now we know it's to square root of P and this looks a lot better because this is something that's a difference of equation that's separate one we can solve that man not too bad you remember that that we have a differential equation it's respect to time so we're gonna move our P's DP are constants DT in this case our independent variable is T so we'll have this one over the square root of P DP equals 2 DT and let's take an integral on both sides on the right hand side be something nice we just have 2t plus it's some sort of arbitrary constant on the left hand side we have this well you might want to think about this as P to the negative 1/2 so let's see with with that we're gonna add one that's P to the one-half over 2 exponent one-half that's 2 square root people I want to do this on your phone P to the positive one half over one-half so I'm gonna get to square root of P now what will we do after that well it's probably good idea to solve for P if you've done that many times before so if we go ahead and we we start solving for P let's see square root of P would be divided by 2 we get this T plus C over 2 not a problem maybe we square both sides we could do that but we do notice something that's up there right now we notice that there's a there's a constant there and if you remember before we get too heavy into this it might be a good idea to solve for C right now we did that even in the last video with a crazy hard stuff we solve for the constant that arbitrary constant first wait a minute help how much so sort of the art is very constant because this tells you the initial value you can always use that to solve your initial need for your arbitrary constant we did it basically in every population we probably have ever done so I might I might go back and say you know what I don't want to do that because if I solve this for P right now without getting that arbitrary constant I'm gonna to go backwards so let's take this and say the initial population population at time 0 is 100 let's plug that in let's say that our populations 100 when our time is 0 and we're going to get let's see 2 times 10 is 20 C equals 20 this is going to give us something a lot nicer because when we solve for P will be done we won't have to go back and solve for that C again so let's rewrite this to square equals now we know that's 2t plus that arbitrary constant no longer arbitrary this was an initial value probably told us the initial value is 100 and squirrels and now look how much nicer is when you start dividing by 2 we can get a a constant that we we know understand and don't have to solve for again so we're gonna get T I'm sorry we're gonna get t plus 10 and if we square both sides we'll get to the population with respect to time is given by this equation T plus 10 squared so let's see we've looked at you read it very carefully we wrote down exactly what a time of change means we wrote down what proportional means new or down with the square root of P means we've got an initial value to problem we wrote down that increasing is is relating to that rate of change it's saying what the rate of change is we were able to solve for that constant of variation we did our integration we were able to solve for the function P our population P we all to give it an arbitrary concept by using the exact same initial value that P of 0 equals 100 and now we have a formula for that that population of squirrels so now we can answer this last question and the way we do this is saying okay well how many are there in one year it's almost always this case where they're going to give you a time you find the population or they give you a population you have to find the time it takes to get there so in this case it says I'm giving you one year how many squirrels that they're gonna be so the population of one year oh wait a minute this is 20 per month so 20 20 per month but I'm giving you I'm giving you 1 year is this going to be accurate if I put in a why is that gonna be accurate is the time unit the same the answer is no it's not be very careful if you're getting the wrong answer in the back of the book can you going back plug it in one man I followed you Leonard yeah well it might be the plug it in different units of time you see if our time rate of change is based on months and they're giving you years we have to realize that one year is 12 months so I'm not gonna be plugging in one I'm gonna be plugging in 12 that's gonna give us something quite different so when we look at it ago right let's see that would be the population after one year or 12 months he's 22 squared looks like I got 484 schools so when we look at it start thinking what would happen if our time did increase a lot and we found out how many schools there are in man 20 years or something is there anything here that's going to slow it down is there anything here that says after certain amount of time or based on the population we're going to be reaching a plateau or or are we going off the scales or are we dropping down to zero and if we look at this basically amount of water population the initial population is check it out I'm not aware of initial population is if it's positive in any way shape or form then this is going to be a positive number this is gonna be a positive number and this is gonna be a positive number so we would have some sort of positive constant we'd solvent pee this would be some sort of time plus a positive constant squared well if this goes further and further and further if this gets increasing to infinity this is going off the charts this would be a population explosion so there's nothing that's that's limiting this we don't even have really a threshold the threshold would be like zero the only way that you would go to extinction is if you didn't start with anything here so if you started with a zero population then you have a constant would be zero but there'd be nothing to start okay so if there's no way that we could ever increase that it won't even make sense but if we start with any population all and we say this is what's happening here just arbitrary increasing at 20 22 Scrolls per month then we're gonna be increasing forever there's nothing that's going to really make this not go to infinity its increasing without bound so let's look at the next example all right so last example for this video just again to get a few but just understanding how to set these problems up even let's talk about rabbits no rabbits do so the time rate of change of a rabbit populations portion of the square of Pico what's what's that mean again the time rate of change is this rate of the population with respect to time so we're talking about a derivative here at time equals zero so whenever this this was studied there is 12 rabbits and then there was 24 rabbits and 10 years after that when will there be 48 rabbits and then we're going to talk about like what I want you to get in the last video in this video is what's going to happen in the future is this going to climb without bound what's good what's gonna happen after that ok well let's let's talk about it so let's try to diagnose every bit about it we'll put it together do a our integration will learn that we can't solve for that cave of the bat let's see why that is so the time rate of change over rabbit population is proportional to square of P what that means is that the way that the population is with respect to time is proportional that's a K times the square of P so now the square root we're gonna have K times P squared let's see how this really affects an integration compare the last problem also look for this other stuff is there an initial value at time equals 0 are there an initial number of rabbits yeah 12 so when there's the start of this problem there are 12 rabbits altogether let's look for this isn't telling you how the population is increasing at that time no it's not is it giving you an another another value so we basically need two of these things one to solve our arbitrary constant and when to solve for R K R our variation coefficient so it says it says that there's there's 12 at the time equals 0 it's not a there's 24 10 years after that oh so it's given us another value so we're looking at this we're trying to identify what they're giving you they're giving you a derivative of population for the sake of time they're giving you that it's proportional that's a K times they're giving you that it's the square of P okay that's P squared they're giving you an initial population of 12 they're giving you a population some time period after that starting to sound very familiar we've done already so after 10 years the population has doubled let's go ahead and since we can't solve for that K right now since we don't know that that's the problem in the previous example we knew what the rate of change was we don't have that now we're going to find it by doing a derivative let's write our integration doing our separable variables here your integration and then let the find out a little bit later so let's start that let's say hey that's a that's a differential equation it is separable it's group our peas DP are constants DT so if we divide everything by P squared DP leave our constants DT and when we integrate let's see what we have we have a integral of P to the negative 2 that's let's add 1 it's negative 1 divided by the new one it's negative 1 that's negative 1 over P equals K T plus some sort of arbitrary constant looks kind of nasty let's up let's fix this a little bit let's go ahead and let's multiply everything by negative so 1 over P equals negative KT minus C do you really want to deal with that - I don't really want to deal with that - either also one other thing that we could do this right now we could wait a little bit we could solve for that constant couldn't we so typically what you've seen me do is before we start doing things like man let's let's multiply both sides by P divided by this or just reciprocate and give this is 1 over arbitrary constant - Katie I'm saying that this could be written as positive C just just Rhea all this C sub one and then that would be a positive C you could do that and you can solve for C but do you see how much time did you see how much time you'd be wasting right now if you're gonna solve for the arbitrary constant right now you're gonna have to undo basically all that work you did so I'm showing you this to say when you do your integral and we've seen this from one of the first sections we did there's a long time to feel like 30 videos ago but one of the first stages we did as soon as you do your integral for integration by parts if you have an initial value it will solve for your arbitrary constant and once all for Kate but it will solve for your C so here's the process go and really read your problem very carefully get your your difference equation write down every piece of information that you know see if you can solve for that K if you're given the rate of change you can if you're not then the process is do your integration to solve your differential equation and soon as as soon as you get this arbitrary constant soon as you do your integration and you get the arbitrary constant its easiest to solve for that now and it's always solvable by your initial value so this guy then after we solve for our constant we can use this second piece of information to solve for your constant variation so again do the integration solve for y or your arbitrary constant your C by using your initial value problem and then solve for your K by using the other piece though what happens later we'll solve that carefully so let's do that let's say hey you know what when our time was zero we had 12 bunnies so negative 1 over 12 equals this whole thing zero that's why we that's why we use the initial value to solve for C because the time deserves itself out equals C so our C is negative 1/12 let's rewrite that so plus negative 12 minus 1/12 now what what now well we just mentioned that if we use our initial value to solve for our scene we can use the next piece of information of software ok so we're gonna do that we're gonna say that now that we know that after 20 years there were 24 bucks says we can plug in 24 for P when we plug in 10 for T and after having solved for that C it leaves us just one more variable so negative 1 over 24 equals K times 10 or 10 K minus 1 12 let's go ahead in that let's add 1 12 to both sides so if we add 1 12 let's see that would be 2 twenty-fourths we're going to get 1 over 24 equals 10 K and if we divide both sides by 10 we're going to get K equals 1 over 2 3 might not look that great but at least we don't have to constants any longer we don't have an arbitrary constant we know this thing 1:12 we don't have our zucchini where we know it's 1 over 240 so what we're gonna do is after we've done an integration we solve for our arbitrary constant no longer arbitrary use initial value for that we solve for a constant variation we now know what that constant is we're going to rewrite this right now so we found C we rewrote it we found Kate we're going to rewrite it again now before we go any further we're about to reciprocate this you can't reciprocate two fractions you can't do that when they're being subtracted or when they're being added so we're gonna take the time we're gonna make a common denominator we're gonna make this one fraction so let's see negative 1 of the P and then the right hand side this right here let's see 1 over 12 and I'm trying to get to 14 to be multiplied by one so 20 over to 14 so t minus 20 over 240-volt know we're due now let's change that so I don't like that let's multiply both sides by a negative so negative 1 or divided by native doesn't remember so 1 over P is going to give us if we multiply both sides by negative let it just affect the numerator or denominator but not both so on the numerator we get positive one repeat here but we get negative T plus 20 or 20 minus T we're just reversing that changing the signs over 240 and now we can reciprocate both sides so our population with respect to time and that time is in year so we're having them back go ahead time is in years is 240 over 20 my esteem and now I ask the question says alright hey can we answer this now I told you last time that when you get down to your population so solving your differential equation you got your population model and it's going to ask you one or two things usually it's gonna say well how much of the what quantity what's your population after certain time or how long does it take to get to a certain population and that's what this one says when will there be 48 bunnies well a wind is what's the time the 48 bunnies is what's your population so if there's 48 buddies how long did it take to get there it's a matter of solving for T now so you've multiplied both sides by that 20 minus T and divided by 48 or if you remember this is a that can be used a portion you can cross multiply no problem me personally I like doing that whole switcheroo thing like if you were to multiply by 20 minus T and divide by 48 you'd get 20 minus T equals 240 over 48 and then if we subtract 20 so 20 minus 28 that's when we subtract that 20 we're going to have 15 but negative 15 oh good thing we divide by negative so T equals 15 now we think about the units this was 15 years everything was in terms of years for us which was nice so in this case there's some slow producing bunnies but if this is true for this population maybe there's a heavy predation maybe it's not growing that rapidly what's gonna happen here is that this population is going to grow and grow and grow and to the point where we have 48 rabbits in 15 years now this is what I want you to get out of this too what's gonna happen at first I hope that explains 1/3 of the to understand how to set these word problems out but the idea the last example was what are we getting out after this what is this population going to do and I want you to look at the time look at that right here what happens as we get closer and closer to 20 years so as we get closer and closer to 20 years well let's see that denominator gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller doesn't it so 20 minus minus 15 would give us a 5 after 48 buddies how about 20 minus 19 what happens in 19 years well in 19 years we got 240 divided by 1 that's 240 bunnies so in four more years this is going to really start that phony it's gonna start exploding what about in like nineteen point nine years nineteen one that's gonna see 20 minus nineteen point nine is point one 240 divided by 0.1 is two thousand four hundred bunnies so it took a long time to get there this is a very slow growth at the beginning man I don't know anything that starts up growing really slow and then it just starts starts exploding like that I don't have anything looks like that that's because that's exactly what this is it's crazy fast growth is what this is this is doing for us so somehow we are going to be starting off super slow but at some point we're going to be exploding as this gets really close to 20 years this population starts really getting crazy crazy big to the point where it's it's reaching infinity we don't even we can't even go anywhere you can't you can't actually get to 20 years it's undefined it's going so fast as I'm to find that population is of doom State population what that means is that you reach such a such an expansive population there's not even room for it anymore like it's it's infinity this is this approaches twenty years this is going to approach infinity do you see it are you seeing that if this approaches twenty years so this approaches twenty this is getting really close to zero to forty divided by something really close to zero is going to positive infinity from the left-hand side it's gonna go to positive infinity that's a doomsday situation where this population is getting so big there's not even room for there's definitely not food for it so I hope that makes sense I hope that you're I'm taking you to think about what's going on just answering the question they've answer the questions 15 years but what's happening after that's important we've talked about the logistic equation we've talked about that the extinction versus explosion that's an explosion idea but now we're we're just getting some basic concepts I'm trying to mirror what we've already learned in the last video so that later on when we get to those examples you're much much better suited to deal with it so I hope this makes sense I hope now yeah a great way to start setting up some word problems and our understanding what can happen in these explosion ideas right now so we'll talk about more of this next time we'll get heavy into it with a logistic equation in a little while okay I hope you enjoyed it I'll see you the next video you
