Transcript for: Population Growth and Decline (Differential Equations 35)
hi it's time to get to another video on some population modeling so we're going to look back at our logistic equation we're gonna look at population explosions and population extinctions we're going to look at these these limiting populations and carrying capacities in terms of just three examples so we have man we've done a lot we learned about how death rates and birth rates affect population growth we've learned how we can explode and go extinct or or reach a limiting population or a carrying capacity depend on what problem we have and so we're going to take a look at these three examples just go through real quickly make sure that we're seeing how to use partial fractions appropriately and and seeing a good interpretation of these things so before we begin though I want to remind you that while these two setups look very very similar and you're gonna get both of these in this this video they're decidedly different on your end result of what you can possibly have for your population so if you haven't watched like three videos ago I encourage you to do that when we talk about the differences here and explore them at length and go through the proofs of why this one right here reaches a plateau this limiting population or carrying capacity and why this one right here explodes or becomes extinct I go into the derivation of that so take a look at that if you haven't that's like three videos ago when we talk about logistic equation and all that entails and population doomsday and extinction so what I want you to get out of this is that when we're taking a look at these yes we're gonna be answering some actual questions stemming from these problems absolutely but more than that I want you to look at what would happen if we went forever all right so what if time goes beyond the the the link that we're talking about I want you to really think about that like what would happen to our populations would they reach a point where they can't grow anymore would they reach a point where they can't decline anymore would they do you know where you start explode until there's no more room or become extinct if there's no much so I want to look at that beyond just the scope of the problem ever trying to get you to think critically about this so hopefully hopefully we can do that so let's take a look at this and let's the first thing we want to notice is that if we have a population that's changing with respect to time according to this I want to look at it right now do you see how this form fits what we've already talked about right here so right now when we say hey the way the populations change it with respect to time is based on this logistic equation or a form of it look how we have this M this M 200 what that says since that is coming before our pm and since this is based on a logistic equation where we have probably a birth rate that's or some linearly proportional to the population that right there that is called either our limiting capacity no sorry limiting population or carrying capacity what's gonna happen with this problem so when we get done this is like this not like this one it's like this one where we have a constant - or population what's gonna happen is we are going to get at the very end that depending on where we start if we start below that 200 we will eventually gain to it but we will never grow more than 200 if we start above that 200 we will decline to a little to never fall below that 200 so so let's look at this at time zero our population was 100 hmm that's below 200 what's gonna happen we're gonna see this after you solve our differential equation is this population will be growing absolutely it even says right here it's growing one per your positive one so it says that and the population was growing at one per year so so think about this if we cannot get higher than 200 we start at 100 and we are growing we are going to see after we solve a different differential equation that there's absolutely no way we're gonna get above 200 we were below it there's nobody to bother had me started above it we would have been declining we would get to it not not below it so we're gonna explore that after we solved the the basic problem so what's the population between 60 years that's the basic problem but again I want you to think past that so let's take a look at it and set it up solve our equation and then we'll we'll see some partial fractions in there as well so the first thing we want to do is identify what our initial conditions are maybe to see if we have a rate of and solve for R K as quickly as possible so let's see our initial conditions given to us right there we know that this is something we're going to use and we're gonna solve we're gonna use that to solve for our arbitrary constant however it's also telling us something right here so according to to our population model our population chain of the spending time with this we had a hundred at the start and we're growing at one per year whenever you see that whenever you see that growing or the rate of change or time rate of change what that means is that this is immediately giving you back its name your population is growing that's that's a rate of change with respect to time at one per year well this is according to years when we're talking about years and years then that growth rate is telling you that the derivative of P with the spring time is one okay let's write that down so population at time zero is 100 that's pretty clear but also the rate of change of our population with respect to time at Year Zero is positive one again that means our populations growing we start below our cap basically our limiting population we start below our cap and we're growing we are going to reach it now since we have our population circle population population and simply we have a rate of change of our population seconds line we can plug in 100 and 101 install 4 okay this happens happens occasionally where we're given our rate of change and they would have studied this said hey we're growing at whatever per year consistently are at this time so let's plug this in let's solve for our concert variation we're going to try to solve our conservation as soon as possible most of the time you'd go ahead and do your integral and you'd solve for your arbitrary constant use your initial condition and then you'd have one of two things either you have your rate of change in the beginning which is case you've solved for K which we're going to do here or if you don't have this if you do not have your rate of change it has to give you what your population did in a period of time after this and so there's really two two cases either I have to give you your rate population specs time or have to say in five years we had a hundred whatever twenty whatever these populations are so it have to give you how the population is varying for you to figure out your constant of variation in this case so we're gonna have to have to have one of those two things in this case I haven't given you initial condition I've given you the rate of change I haven't given you how the population has actually changed in a certain amount of time I've given me this so we can sell for a cave right now that's great so let's plug this in so our rate of change of population strikes time is one we're solving for K we know our initial population is 100 to keep in mind to you that this was at time zero and this is also at time zero it's gotta match up so our population is changing with respect to time when we first started this at growth of one per year maybe there's one thousand per year and this is a hundred thousand units of population I'm just paring down the numbers for us but these have to not jump so we say our growth rate is one per year at Year Zero we had a hundred at Year Zero now we just fill our model out so our population was one hundred initial population and we're growing at one per year again you either have to have the growth rate or you have to have how that population is varying up to certain amount of times so it's either you solve for K now if you have the growth rate if you don't you're forced to do your differential equation and then use your initial condition to solve for the arbitrary constant C and then how the population changed for a period of time to solve for your K that makes sense we've done that we've done both of these cases already let's solve for that case so let's see let's see that's a hundred that's a hundred so that's 10,000 I'll divide by 10,000 let's see two zeroes two zeroes for zero okay yeah so 10,000 so we're able to solve for a cake because I gave you the initial condition and how the population was growing let's plug that in right now so we're gonna change model right now and to say since we solve for arcade the rate of change of our population with respect to time is now 1 over 10,000 P 200 - fine and as soon as we do that we have this differential equation and we know that that separation of variables and because we practice those partial fractions which were certainly going to get last video we're pretty set up for it what I didn't want to do I didn't want to get here like hey remember Corrections and I meant to go redo that so partial fractions are real important I gave you that video last time to make sure that I just really killed it to make sure that we we were good here so since we have this step this difference equation since it's separation of variables let's move our P and 200 minus P on the left so P DP our constant DT if you hadn't had that rate of change of population so if I had not given you this what would have happened is this would be okay right now it actually would be a big deal we've done several problems like that you would have done your integration then what you would have done you use your initial condition to solve your arbitrary constant that we're about to get and then you would have to have some sort of population change to solve for that Batcave so in our case we go alright hey you know what we take an integral no problem we can do that on the right hand side pretty easy we're gonna get T over 10,000 plus C that constant on the left hand side though well man we're gonna have to do partial fractions do you see it but that's there's another way to go about it we're gonna have to set do partial fraction decomposition and how do we do that is we say this would be since we have two linear factors a over the first one here that's a constant I'll plus B over the second linear we practice this a ton in the last video not an issue we would say get a common denominator and if you get a common denominator your numerators we have to be equal because your denominators are to be equal in this equation so one would equal a times 200 minus P plus B times P we're just finding a common denominator I had teachers say well you got to do the cover-up method and doing this with you're trying to become a denominator that's all you're really doing and then plug in P equals zero it's going to get rid of this term and so once you get a was one over 200 plug in P equals 200 if you plug in P equals 200 this will be 0 that will be 200 and we will divide by 200 get 1 over 200 so let's rewrite this and see what it does is since this integral is 1 over P times 200 minus P we now know that that's separated by these two fractions a is 1 over 200 B is also 1 over 2 Klenner what I'm gonna do is I'm going to write this as 1 over 200 times P 1 over 200 times 200 minus P I'm not going to distribute it we're going to immediately factor out that 1 over 200 so let's do that right now so 1 over 200 P plus 1 over 200 minus P times 200 let's factor that 1 over 200 that's exactly what this was same exact thing let's factor that how we saw that a lot last video to that that that constant that we get is often times the same or off by a sign so 1 over 200 integral of 1 over P plus 1 over 200 - P DP I'm also gonna do one more thing you saw a little I would say a trig but something that's gonna make our math a little bit easier I really don't want to have to deal with with chain rules or you subs when doing these integrals so what I might do here I might pull that negative out right here so I'm gonna factor this negative someone write this as negative P plus 200 I'm gonna factor that maybe seems to be negative out and also I want this guy to be negative not this one that way when I group my ll ends that were about to get I have a single term on the denominator rather than two terms because that way we don't have to distribute as much and you're gonna see that in just a minute so what I want to do is I'm gonna write that says hey man 1 over P great plus 1 over negative P plus 200 I'm gonna do all my work here then I'm gonna race it to show you why we're getting what I'm about to get after that I'm gonna factor out this this negative which would give us that this negative P plus 200 or foot pull up at negative P minus 200 but I really don't want this guy to be negative because we're not getting my L ends which we're gonna get right now upon our integration I really want to have to divide by this and not this so I'm a factor than negative out of the entire integral super necessary no but I find it helps so I'm gonna write this so bad I have positive on the denominator positive variable minus a constant rather than the other way around I'm also going to write this so that my single term fractions over single terms on the denominator fractions are negative and my my dual term are my binomials are plus so positive or plus so what our integral becomes basically I mean I'm going to just erase all this but what we ended up doing is we rewrote this factor negative factor to negative so negative 1 over 200 and then negative 1 over P plus 1 over P and minus 200 just a little bit of algebraic manipulation but I find it helps we're actually almost done what we're gonna do is we're gonna integrate both sides now on the right hand side pretty easy we're gonna get T over 10,000 plus some sort of arbitrary constant might look like and C sub 1 why what am I about to get what am I about to get over here so we're gonna integrate right what am I about to get well I'm gonna get some L ends how do you undo L ends you you do that e to the Ln thing and you compose inverse functions are gonna cancel but on the right hand side I'll have plus or minus e to the C sub 1 we're gonna wrap all of that up into our constant so on the left hand side this is negative 1 over 200 leave it we're going to get this negative Ln absolute value P plus Ln absolute value of P minus 200 do you see why we might have wanted to write this with that PV and positive that way we don't have to forget our flow don't have a chance of forgetting to do a use of and and pulling out that negative so when we spend the time to do some algebra here and say yeah I really I really don't want that to be a minus because if I would have done it there it's not a huge deal but I would have had negative Ln 1 over 200 minus P I would have had to do that use of in my head I don't have to be that so in writing these with our P positive we avoid a sign error and you guys to know that sign errors are like the number one mistake that we get so be careful with that also the reason why we factored out the negative here is so that when we combine these elements which we're about to write now we're going to get Ln of P minus 200 over P and not P over P minus 200 that's going to save us a multiplication distribution collecting terms instead we'll just have to multiply and collect terms it saves us one step again is it super super important that you do it exactly my late no I'm not trying to get you to do a big step in my way I'm trying to think about what way works best for you so for me this works very well after that man what would I do now I'd probably collect these like I said it was going to so negative one over 200 Ln P minus 200 over P equals T over 10,000 plus C sub 1 now what well I can't do that Ethan yet not until I multiply by negative 200 so let's do that let's multiply everything by negative 200 I'm gonna get rid of this I'd have to distribute so we'll have them Ln absolute value P minus 200 no problem over P God and absolute value equals when I multiplied by negative 200 let's see that's going to be negative T over 50 minus 200 C sub 1 now I have told you in the past that you plug in your initial condition to solve for that C as soon as you can now what I mean by as soon as you can as soon as it's nice to do so where you don't have to change your arbitrary constant anymore so we're gonna plug in this initial condition but we're not gonna do it until after we wrap up our C so you think about sometimes you plug it in sometimes you don't when you do that I explain that a long time ago but if you don't remember that's okay when we plug in this initial condition is if we don't have natural log we do it right away if we do have natural log so when you're gonna have to exponentiate both sides you said take both as an exponent onto that e you wait until you wrap up that plus or minus e to the C sub whatever wrap that whole thing up as that gigantic see and then you do it so when you have the natural logarithm you wait just a bit other than that you man you normally just plug it in right away so I'm not gonna be solving for C now I'm not going to plug that in it's incredibly messy what we're gonna do is we're gonna wait just a little bit longer so when we say hey now I've got this Ln so wrapping this up we did some work with our signs no problem to make this a little bit easier to see to make it so that later when I multiply it just have to multiply by P and not P minus 200 I don't have this you said with a negative sign in there I don't the worry about that I wrapped up my L ends I have my constant over here with a C sub 1 and now we're gonna say because we got the Ln we're gonna have e on both sides this e Ln is gone but remember what we can do we can take the plus and minus we can say this part right here would be e to the negative T over 50 that's no problem but this would be times remember when you add exponents it came from common bases so that when they separate the addition or subtraction I have these common bases being multiplied together this right here eetu the negative 2 or 50 great times e to the negative 200 C sub 1 and then we can write the absolute value of plus or minus so plus or minus e to the negative 200 C sub 1 this entire piece of jungle right there that's one big constant so we're gonna say let's call that C that's a concept called see this is what I'm saying when I say plugin you're plugging your initial value as soon as you can but when you can depend on what you have if you have a natural logarithm you wait you wait until right here you go okay now I've wrapped that that up as a seed this is where you don't want to plug in your initial value so when we plug this in we go okay now my initial value said at time zero I had 100 units of population like 100,000 so 100,000 units population I'm going to plug in that 100 now when T is zero so I look at 100 when time is zero let's see negative zero zero or 5008 of the zeros 1 c times 1 is 1 on the left hand side you get negative 100 over 1/3 that's negative 1 so C is negative 1 that makes sense all right I'm gonna have to racist but we're pretty close to done so one time just to make sure that we're crystal clear we looked at this and said right now that right there is a limiting population so we started below this number below this M that's a limited population our population cannot outpace that what we're looking for is what's the population in 60 years great no problem so since we had our initial population and a rate of change we were able to plug this and install 4k that's first that happens sometimes doesn't happen all the time if you're not given that that rate of change which you will be given is an initial condition that you used to solve for C after doing your all your integration with a k then you plug in find your seat then you use how the population is varied after say like 3 years or something and then you'd be able to solve for that K so that would come right after this you plug that in and you'd have to solve for K next so we did all that work we use some partial fraction decomposition and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna plug this in that C equals negative 1 we're going to answer our questions so P minus 200 over P equals negative 1 e to the negative T over 50 now I will show you how to solve for 4p right now because if you look at our question we're not asking and really I want you to think about what they're asking you okay so if it asks us something like when will the population equal 175 when will the population be 95 percent of your limiting population so will the world's that mean multiply that number times four point nine five and you would figure out the nine five you figure out 95% of this limiting population is you okay if I'm asked us out find the time when we reach a population even if it's like 95 percent of that number the living population two hundred ninety five percent would be whatever that is I would plug it in right now I wouldn't take the time to solve RP because if I'm trying to find the time when I reach the population plugging the population it's a lot easier then change the sign take an L n divided by negative fifty and you you have it so if you're asked to find the time from a pop to get a certain population don't waste your time solving for P right now let that be a waste of time because you're trying to solve for T that's going backwards in our case we're gonna has to do that we're saying what's the population so we want to solve for population after sixty years that that's an amount of time so we are gonna solve for P but keep that in mind so I think the next example asked how long is it take to get to this certain population we're not gonna be taking a time to solve for T at least not for that reason so let's go ahead let's multiply both sides by ki this is the reason why I wanted this single variable on the denominator because it's a little easier to multiply I just have to multiply by P instead of two terms and then distribute so P minus 200 equals negative PE the negative T over 50 then we're gonna group our peace and our our non P terms that way we can factor P and divide so I'm going to add and add so T plus PE to the negative T over 50 equals positive 200 because we're adding to Leonard we're adding P P to the negative T over 50 we factor our P and we divide and we get that the population at any given time is 200 over 1 plus e to the negative T over 50 home now we can answer the question but I'm gonna ask you something after that so don't just stop when we answer this question answer the question says what's the population in 60 years that's that's very easy because we have T is in years this is in years T is a number plug in 60 we get 200 over 1 plus e to negative sixty fifty it's six bits and if I've done it right it's about a hundred fifty three hundred fifty forty million Wow sorry her 54 whatever these needs are so about 154 well I think I said thousands ten it doesn't really matter what it is but you get about 150 four units of population whatever those units are I hope that makes sense I hope I've explained well enough the interplay between the partial fractions and maybe some good ideas on how to structure them so that you're not dealing with signs and you subs and multiplying and distributing all that stuff hopefully that makes sense to you secondly what I really want to get out of it yes answer the question so okay hey what's the population in sixty years 154 notice how its approaching bat number two but I want you to go further than that I want you to think about it look back right you're back right here true or false an exponential is always positive true or false no matter what that number is is that true Exponential's look like this when you have a negative like you do T is always positive right it's always time exponentially like this they're declining but they have a horizontal asymptote at light at y equals zero so they're never gonna be equal zero they're never gonna even be negative so you're going to get this it's gonna get really close to zero so wait a minute as time goes on this gets really really close this number gets really really close to zero but it's still positive so you have one plus some number this can't be negative so you have one plus something that's getting close to zero the smallest the smallest this denominator can ever be is 1 that means the largest as fraction could ever be as 200 that means your population is limited it has a limiting population of 200 there's no way to get above that it's impossible no matter how far that goes is that not man if that goes further that's just getting closer closer to zero that means your populations getting closer and closer to 200 do you see it do you see how having a model like this with this number positive and first that number right there is your limiting population if you start below it or your carrying capacity if you start above it's it's going to limit to that somehow I hope that makes sense I'm already seeing that right now that this right here is positive and you can never get more than 200 if you started above that you could never get less than 200 the sign will change there but that's about all you get so anyhow I hope that makes sense what we're gonna do now is we're going to talk about two more where we introduced a birth rate and death rate and see how that changes a problem a little bit all right let's start another one so a certain population has a birth rate up now send a little more familiar Oh point zero zero one according to population so it is proportional to the population and a constant death rate Delta all right so there are 100 units at year 2000 and scrolling at eight units per year let's diagnose exactly what's going on so firstly we have a birthrate we have a constant death rate this is giving us birth rate and death rate I hope to remember this but whenever we're given a birth rate death rate we can start our population model population with respect to time would be given by this difference in birth rate minus death rate times the population that's great also if the death rate is constant it shouldn't be based on the population so this should not have a P the birthrate however does so the birthday says hey it's proportion to the population so I'm just kind of getting a feel for it thinking model my thinking here taking all right certain birthrate and a certain population has a birth rate and death rate I'm going to start with this cool can i plug something in for the birth rate yes I'm gonna be doing that so birth rate is point zero zero one p it is based on the population awesome that's gonna go here the death rate is constant it should not have a P in it it's just gonna be a number but I know what it is there are 100 units at year 2000 and what's that mean does that mean that should put P of mm equals 100 the answer is no no this this year is when we started looking at this and so what we're going to do is we're going to say that the population at time zero is 100 it just so happens that time zero was was the year 2000 so what that means is that when we look at how long it took double we're going to get an answer in year say it's 80 years I don't know what's going to be so if it's 80 years then we'd say it's gonna double in the year 2018 so we shouldn't add that on to that so basically we subtract 2000 and then we would get an answer we add the 2,000 back that's that's essentially where we're doing well okay so so we got this we have we know our population laws based on this okay got our birth rate we have our and idea of a death rate we know there are a hundred units at year it's called zero and oh it's growing great what does that mean what's the growing mean well that's that's it that's true that's exactly that means the population is growing that's the rate of change of population with respect to time in years it's growing at eight units per year and it says that that's at the time when we knew our initial population so at the year 2000 or at t equals zero we have a growth rate of eight units of population per year so one time make sure we got it we're looking at it saying birth rate and death rate start here start there with unless they specifically tell you otherwise start there with birth rates and death rates okay what's our birth rate we're gonna plug that in what's our death rate I don't know and leave it there we'll talk about that in a minute there are a hundred units at year 2000 let's call that your zero understanding that our answer at the end is gonna be based on the fact that year 2000 is called your zero year and we're growing at Oh growing growing means the the rate of change of population with respect to time add that same here is a how long it use for year how long does it take to double okay so how long is it taking don't what's that mean are we looking for a population given a time or a time given the population if we start at 100 the double would be 200 I find the time when we reach 200 so what this translates to in write down now time to reach population equal 200 notice what I'm doing what I'm doing is I'm trying to get a real good solid grasp on the problem before I start what I don't do I don't just arbitrarily throw up a formula and try to work with it that's crazy what I'm trying to do is get everything we know about this written down so I know we're based on that formula because it has birth rates and death rates and that's our model for birth rates and death rates according to population change I know that we have a hundred units at the start I know we're growing at so are the derivative of P with respect to time is eight I also know that I'm looking for a time here so what what's the time to reach a population of double or 200 even since we started at 100 now we're gonna start plugging things in so since we're gonna do that let's see let's start with our birth rate we don't know a death rate that's interesting but wait a minute we also don't have a cave well let's see what would that cave in when we looked back at the when we looked at those those equations first I will first start of this video we have that K times P and then parentheses with either P - amber and minus P what that K came from that Kant came from the birth rate death rate idea so somewhere in there is a death rate we'll wait a minute well what if we did this instead of trying to solve for some K - something there could we use this information to solve for the death rate if it's if K is coming from that idea anyway can we solve for a console wait a minute all that's great death rate is constant it's a constant death rate if they're giving you the initial population you can plug in 100 you and they're giving you how the population is respecting change of expected time 8 you can play an 8 you can plug in 100 and 100 and you can solve for the constant death rate that's the constant of it's not really the constant variation here but it is a concept of we can solve for so when they're giving you when they're giving you how something's growing it's a real pretty it's real good indication so you're gonna be using that right at the back to solve for some sort of a constant we're gonna do that right now so since we're going to solve for that concept let's say hey the way the population is changing with respect to time at time 0 is 8 units per year at year 0 so same exact period of time here starting at year 2000 we had a population of 100 we had a death rate that I don't know we're about to find out and the same exact initial population so when we start dividing now let's see that 36.0 let's divide we could do might be a little bit nicer if we just distribute so we don't dig you up eight or 100 what if we just distribute this remember this is one thing term so you don't distribute 3 times 2 times 100 times 0.01 movemove would be point 1 point 1 times 100 minus 100 d'etre but then point 1 times 100 moved twice would be 10 so 8 equals 10 minus 100 times a death rate so let's see if we do if we subtract so he some either subtract 8 add 100 Delta or subtract 10 and then divide by negative honor doesn't matter subtracting 10 we get negative 2 and divided by negative 100 we get 1 over 50 or point 0 2 since we already have a decimal so we get point 0 2 so two levels that we can plug it in let's go ahead and do that we're going to plug in that point 0 2 and then we're going to look at this as a as our nice differential equation so point 0 2 so our population is changing with respect to time according to our model 0.001 population minus 0.02 all times population you know else I might do because you know we're gonna do right we're gonna we're gonna try to get this separable differential equation which it already is but I want to keep my constants on the right hand side that point zero zero one and that point zero two that's really nasty so I'm gonna rewrite it just a little bit because I don't want to have to deal with partial fractions involving those crazy coefficients I don't think you want to do that either so we're going to factor out whatever constant has the smaller number let's set the smaller number so the larger number of digits after the decimal so we're gonna divide and factor out point zero zero one I'm also going to write the P first so dreaming about P with respect to time let's go ahead and let's factor that zero point zero zero one I'll write my P first I'm factoring that out so this P is right here I'm not factoring a Peter I'm factoring just a constant point zero zero one that would give us a P minus 0.02 divided by point zero zero one so to music to 20 oh yeah man this and that that's what's with 20 so when we divide point zero zero two by point zero zero one point zero two by point zero zero one we get 20 so we've all we've done we wrote in this P first we factor two point zero zero one out of that why because now when we have this several difference equation and I hope you see it's real nice we're going to write our P's DP we're gonna write our constant DT that's 1,000 and now we're ready to integrate you see that nice the nicest of that now that we when we factor that one over a thousand it made it real real nice for us to groom bar P over F sorry one over P times P minus twenty now we can integrate you should be do this on your own you really should be integrating saying that's partial fractions I know how to do that now on the right hand side T over a thousand plus C sub one you'll understand that with partial fractions you're going to get natural logarithms so when we do our integral and get that T over one thousand plus C sub one I'm not gonna solve for that C I'm not gonna plug in my initial value I'm gonna wait until I wrap up that as plus and minus e to the constant that's making sense you like yeah I get that you you're doing a great job okay you're really understanding it because you've seen this so many times and now you're you're really flowing with it so great if that's you with partial fractions we go okay well you know what we can write this as a decomposition of two fractions with linear denominators that it gives us constant numerators so if you find a common denominator one equals a times t minus 20 plus B times P that says if you let P equal zero let's see that's zero that's zero negative eight would be 1 over negative 20 if P equals 20 that's zero B would be 1 over 20 and as you see before often times you keep the same constants with this let's go ahead let's rewrite up that integral as 1 over knit well negative 1 over 20 P plus 1 over 20 times P minus 20 so this becomes negative 1 over 20 this becomes 1 over 20 times this denominator and just like before we're gonna factor out that one over 20 now should i factor a negative from here what do you think chef after a negative from that P minus 20 or do I like the P being positive I like the P being positive should i factor out a negative from here and change this to a minus and this to a plus no because I don't like this being 1 over P and having that P go to the denominator right come on my Ellen's are you seeing this makes sense to you so I'm gonna leave this as a minus because I want a single term on the denominator of my natural logarithm that we're about to get I'm gonna leave this as positive because I like to not have to use a use of to change my sign when I do that integral of 1 over t minus 20 so I'm gonna leave them the signs where they are I'm just gonna factor out the 1 over 20 it looks pretty clean but we're about ready to integrate right now so we're going to leave that 1 over 20 so this is 1 over 20 you all know how to take an integral of 1 over P but it is negative so negative Ln absolute value P plus since we don't have a negative coefficient since we just have P minus 20 you have a very trivial u so because that DPD you would be positive 1 you don't even show it you go yeah this is going to be plus Ln absolute value P minus 20 no need to worry about sign that's why we like that equals on the right hand side T over 1,000 plus C sub 1 why see sublime we're about to multiply everything by 20 we're about to group our natural logarithms as Ln of P minus 12 absolute value P minus 20 over P we're about to take both sides to that he is an exponent both sides we're about to wrap up a plus and minus e sea sublime as twenty see someone as a arbitrary constant so we're going to wait we're gonna wait to use our initial value would you really want to plug in that right now and try to solve for C no I I don't I don't I don't know yet so we're gonna wait if you have to if you have an L n wait just a little bit so plug in C as soon as you can but that also means as soon as it's really nice to do so a lot of times its first but if you have natural logarithm you are going to wait so I'm going to group these right up here I'm also going to multiply by 20 so let's let me show that here I'm going to multiply both sides by 20 so we get this let me make sure you guys are following my board work too I'm going to multiply by 20 I'm going to cancel out my 20s on the left hand side I'm going to get this negative Ln absolute value P plus Ln absolute value of P minus 20 on the right hand side we're going to distribute so let's see that's 1 over T or 50 plus 20 C sub 1 net will group them this is really nice we're going to get this Ln of we know that when we subtract logarithms or add logarithms we can make one logarithm with a quotient where they're positive or added logarithms create this argument on the numerator and then the subtracted or negative is on the denominator we're ready for it now when we do that e let's see e and both of these act as exponents on that e exponential function we are going to get let's see on the right hand side this gives us an e to the T over 15 this gives us x e to the 20 C sub 1 the absolute values give us a plus and minus and we get this P minus 20 over P this whole piece right there it's still a constant this is what we define to be our arbitrary constant C so if you're having a right C sub 1 wait to plug in your initial value if you're not if you're not gonna have to change it then right when you integrate you plug in your initial value solve for your seat but if you have an extra logarithm in wait till right here so t minus 20 over P equals arbitrary constant e to the T over 15 and now we can do it so now we say hey you know what our initial population we're going to use that again and if you remember that we sort of do that when we had a sulphur K we use our initial population of salt for arbitrary constant C but then since that was in there we solved for our K after that well we we had to kind of use it twice well we're using it twice here we used it once the software constant death rate that was that point zero two that we got a while back and we're going to use it again to solve our arbitrary constant C so let's put it in so at time zero or the year 2000 we had 100 units of population whatever they were well that means that our population is 100 wintertime is zero this whole thing is 1 so C equals what we get 80 4/5 so when we rewrite this yeah you know what population minus 20 over population is equal to this 4/5 e to the T over 50 so we have set it up we have solved for our constant because they gave a how our populations change of expected time that was what allowed us to do that otherwise that would have an estate and we would have had to have some sort of a change in population after a certain amount of time to solve for that later so had you not had this he would have done all this work with Delta in there and then you would be plugged in your initial condition to solve for your seat right there but there to still be that Delta somewhere and you have to have the way your population is changing after certain amount of time to solve for that and be a little bit more tricky we did that two videos ago that's a little more tricky so now think about the next part of it we've done all this work how long does it take to double your population or what's the time needed to reach P equals 200 what you want to solve for P right now stop asking me that it's asking us all for time so solving the answering the basic question is when what's the time when our P's gonna be 200 fine T when P was 200 you don't need to solve for P right now plug in the two hundred for P and you can easily solve for T so when we do that two hundred and minus 20 over 200 times sorry equals 4/5 either than the T over 50 that's 180 over 200 that's 9/10 if we multiply by 5/4 from both sides its 90s now what you got to yell it if we do Ln on both sides right now so nine eggs and a nice even 50 let me say hey we're solving for T you box you solve for P and that's asking for time to reach certain population plug in right now you save yourself a tremendous amount of work if you're only worrying about solving the question they're asking you which I'm not much more worrying about other things than that but if you're only worried about solving the question they're asking you then do the easiest way possible so yeah I just want to find T when the population is 200 great plug in now solve it all the way down we would have this Ln of 9 8 equals T over 15 if we multiply both sides by 15 our time is 50 times Ln 9/8 I got about see what's his years I get about five point nine years so according to our model it's going to take about five point nine years for us to reach that now am I only concerned about it well not really I mean I'd like to do a little bit more with that so so let's see what if I solve for what if I solve for B remember what I want you thinking of I want you to think of what's gonna happen in the population after after certain amount of time so after time goes on further than this so what about twenty years what about what about that like how what would be happening here so I'm a racist we've answered a question we know the population is gonna double in five point nine years wait a minute what did years that would be 2005-2006 in this case so we started year 2000 and we have a hundred units we're going eight units per year we did this families take a double six years roughly so about 2006 we can expect this population to have doubled and then some now I want to go back in on assault repeating so if you're only interested in something the question you're done okay you're absolutely done I want you thinking further than that so what would happen if we did solve with you let's multiply both sides by P let's group our P terms and our non P terms let's factor our P let's divide there's a little goodness so what is going to happen well think about this look at your denominator and you tell me is this always positive is e to some power always positive sure it is and it should be increasing that since the time is positive we are going to be increasing it's going to be growing four-fifths of that it's still going to be positive but one minus a positive number gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller until it gets well very close to two zero isn't it so one minus a number so one minus some positive number is going to be like okay 0.9 and point maybe point point zero not even point zero zero zero zero zero one how about point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one it's gonna be really close to zero that 20 is gonna start exploding in business so as time goes on we are going to get explosion out of this that's what's gonna happen if we started yeah we're gonna get explosion out of it had we had a negative growth we would have got extinction out of it so on or modern man that wouldn't have changed signs so one Romana right now because we have this positive number and one minus it we're gonna get one minus and small positive numbers but those numbers you can keep increasing increased increasing until get really really really really close to zero 20 does a constant 20 divided by something really really really close to zero it's going to start exploding this will get a population explosion as we keep on going it has to happen that way how we had negative growth we would have got this population decline and where that negative growth would come from is how we started if our initial population would have been above a threshold or below a threshold that would determine that so that we got well it's kind of telling you how this growing but had we got something less than 20 and declining we would have dumped this thing we've just gone straight to zero so anyway I hope that makes sense I hope you're seeing that I hope you're seeing that as four fifths e to the T over 50 approaches 1 our population approaches infinity as this number approaches one so as that gets bigger and bigger and bigger closer to one let's add two approaches zero t over something approaching stairs sorry 20 over something approaching zero is approaching infinity man I hope that makes sense I hope I'm explaining that not not just the answer the questions I'm going way beyond that I want you to see the modeling so I want you to be putting this together with what limits do so you can see what these populations are actually supposed to do in however many years that's going to take figure that out to you yeah we could so as this approaches 1 that would mean that as 4/5 e to the T over 50 it's getting really close to equaling 1 well what would that mean multiply both sides by 5/4 taking Ln of both sides and multiply by 50 then T would be let's see multiply both sides by 5/4 you get 5/4 ln would get rid of that e multiplying by 50 if you put that in your calculator as T approaches that number whatever that is your population is going to approach infinity so as we get closer and closer to whatever number that that one is you're going to get closer and fattie so just doing this off the top of my head here we've got 11 0.16 years so if this goes on unimpeded at the year 2011 point one six after eleven point one six years we are going to get very very close to an infinite population so I hope you've seen the connection on these I hope I'm making it make sense we've got one more to do okay I hope you're still with me I hope you still have your attention I hope that you're following these these examples because this is the last time I can make some connections for you between the last four videos that we've done so we're gonna do one more it's quite similar we'll talk about how this is going to be a doomsday or explosion situation we'll talk about I'll make a connection between why the formula gave you the very beginning the video and this one makes sense and that this is going to model that so we certain population has a birthrate that's proportional to population and a constant death rate but it's giving it to you there are 200 units a year 2100 and growing at 2 units per year when does doomsday occur so it's telling you this is going to have a population explosion let's see why in order to start this I'm gonna go quite quickly through it this is just something that I want to make a connection to so if you can do yourself this great how do we start this assay we need a birth rate and death rate oh right we're given something regarding that so the way our populations change with respect to time is going to be based on this difference between birth rate and death rate times a population but we know a couple other things about it they said our birth rate is proportional to our population it didn't give us the rate of portion ality it didn't give us our constant of variation but it said it is proportional so we have a constant of variation times our p we also know that our death rate is constant and saying that we're dying at a point zero one units of population per sorry point zero one deaths per unit of population per unit of time at our time is in years let's say this is in thousands of units of population so we had 200,000 things at year 2100 and we're going at 2,000 per year so we'd have point zero one thousand deaths per thousand people per year or units of whatever this is we also know that at time zero which is twenty one hundred we had 200 units and we were off this is awesome we were growing at two units per years so this would be 200 growing it I guess I don't need it up here to 200 units of time zero that were growing at two units per year hope this all makes sense to you that we have a birth minutes proportion we talk about that we have a death ray this constant great we can plug in it we have two units at the start beating those 21 interviews in time of zero we're growing at that's a derivative with respect to time at time zero so same time of two units per year let's plug this in and see what we can do so since we have this birth rate that is proportional to the population and a depth ring that is constant we can make some substitutions but more than that let me ask you are we going to be able to solve for K right now number K is just a constant just like we saw for our Delta last time okay is it constant can we do it well are you given an initial population sure are you given the way the population has changing with respect to time at that initial time if the answer is yes you plug it in now if answer's no then what would happen is that you'd be given this what the population is after a certain amount of time if you're not given this rate of change then you solve this the way it is all the way down you solve your arbitrary constant using the initial condition and then you use how your population varied after certain amount of time those two videos ago that we did those problems right now we're given that rate or given this population so we can plug that in this is we're growing at two units at time zero when our population was 200 at time zero let's see / that that's 1 over 100 to Burger King well that's 1 over 100 so if I add that that's gonna be 2 over 100 so 200 or 150 and if we divide by 200 three four zeros k is 1 over 10,000 yeah yeah that right what's that say what mmm that means that we can plug in this 110,000 right there that's exact we're gonna do that's all we did remember that using your initial condition solves for arbitrary constant we're gonna do that yet to come but it also is incorporated along with how your populations changing either direct derivative to plug it in or a high in population exchange understood amount of time we use that later so somehow we're gonna use that away the population is changing sulfur artery constant in conjunction with the initial population let's plug that in right there so we have this 1 over 10,000 - you can write it as 1 over 100 if you want to you doesn't really matter wonderful 100 times P much like the last example I had those in decimals last time but right now I have them in interactions doesn't matter what we're gonna do is do a little bit of rewriting you see right now that's separable it's a several different differential equation we are about to group our peas DP and are constants DT but these constants are really nasty of work within partial fractions so we are going to factor that out we're gonna factor out the one that is smaller so we're factor out the smaller number one over 10,000 is smaller than 1/100 so we're gonna factor that and we're going to right RP first so we're gonna have something that looks like that or writing RP first we're gonna factor out one over 10,000 well that's gonna leave us with in here is P so factoring out from right here one over 10,000 leave us a P first - let's see 1 over 100 divided by 1 over 10,000 so that's a complex fraction multiplied by the reciprocal you're gonna get what's a good no pause here's where I get to make the connection we have just written this in certain form so you can see something I want you to to backtrack hopefully took notes on it any at the very very beginning I give you one of two things I give you either this one of them is a limited population somehow you're gonna reach that if the P is less than M you'll get to M eventually if P is greater than M you'll get two and eventually it's somehow you're gonna get there here and this called your threshold if P is above your M you're gonna explode if P is below your M you're gonna sink you go extinct this right now look at this here's your 100 years our M that 100 is a threshold if we had a population below that we would be declining forever to 0 if we have a population above that we're going to be exploded let's look at our population it says that we started with 200 units if we start with 200 units that's above 100 this is going to have a positive growth and it's going to become explosion and you're going to get some sort of a doomsday scenario where you explode the population no more room no more food that's what I wanted you to see I want to see the connection between setting the stuff with birth rates and death rates and what we get is modeled by one of these two things here so logistic and then explosion extinction so when we get this P minus some sort of a threshold number if we start above that number you are going to go extinct that's right well you're gonna go to an explosion if you start below that you're going to go to an extinction event anyhow let's work this out and see that that actually plays out for us now that we've written this a lot better let's group our P's DP I'd really like for you to do this on your own do your integration do your partial fractions over here on the left hand side and see what you get out of it you pause the video or something since we have these two linear factors that's going to create two fractions factors equal fractions and partial fraction decomposition linear denominators constant numerators we're gonna find a common denominator we're gonna say what if P was zero home if P was zero gone it would be negative 1 over 100 if P is 100 gone B would be 1 over 100 and we see everything the same thing several times now so we're going to rewrite our our fractions as negative 1 over 100 P plus 1 over 100 but P minus 100 and this is perfect man so exactly the one I'm gonna factor out the 1 over 100 of course because that's that common coefficient that we can factor out but I like how this is a minus sign notice that minus sign I have a single term plus sign I have two terms that P is positive I'm not gonna have to you have a you so with a negative in there this is exactly how I want it so let's factor out that negative 1 or what I started that positive 100 not negative and then we'll go ahead and integrate you know we said look not with so big it's y'all crunchy over there if we integrate we're gonna still have this one over 100 but we're going to get negative Ln X of 90 people plus Ln absolute value B minus 1 I'm reelin equals t over 10,000 plus C but I need to see someone for hopefully an obvious reason right now let's multiply everything by 100 that's going to clear out this fraction I'll be grouping these two melons together with a less single logarithm with a quotient inside that denominator on the right hand side will also be multiplied by 100 so we're gonna get this Ln absolute value P minus 1 I'm a positive or plus on the table over P negative or minus on the bottom of equals x 100 let's see typically two users as T over 100 plus 100 C sub 1 now we're ready to have those as an exponent its this P minus 100 over P gives us this plus or minus e to the 100 C sub 1 times e to the T over 100 that looks really good this whole thing we're going to call that C just our arbitrary constants so P minus 100 over P equals arbitrary constant times e to the T one better what do you use to get rid of an arbitrary constant well you're just rebelling so we're gonna plug that in right now so as soon as you can you can't really do it right here not easily so as soon as you can with logarithms means when you get rid of all rules and now we plug that and we say hey at the beginning of this scenario at 2001 or twenty one one year 2100 you had hasn't happened yet unless you're watching this video wait after I made it she's awesome see but at the Year Zero here you had 200 units so P of 0 is 200 you brought that down right there as well so P of 0 that's 200 so 200 minus 100 over 200 equals C times 1 because 0 over 100 is 0 e to the 0 is 1 so we're gonna get 100 over 200 it's 1/2 C is 1/2 very close let's erase some stuff and finish it up so coming back here since we solve for our seat we now know that P minus 100 over B equals 1/2 e to the T over 100 we're going to multiply by B we're going to group our P terms and group our non key terms and office decided to factor out the P and then we're going to divide so multiplying by P grouping our P terms and our non P terms factoring that P and dividing and knows what it does tells us right up top that right there is your threshold start above that you're going to increase forever start below that you're gonna decrease forever on the denominator when does our doomsday event happen at what time would this start getting read or would this become really really really close to infinity this whole population becomes close to infinity when this becomes close to zero so as 1 minus 1 over 2 e to the T over 100 approaches zero our population is going to approach infinity having to solve something like this set it equal to what you're trying to approach so 1 minus 1/2 e to the T over 100 8.0 add to both sides multiplied by 2 to see the logarithm multiplied by 100 and let's think about it as t approaches this number this whole thing is going to approach zero isn't it so as T approaches and when I did this already about sixty nine point three years as T approaches sixty nine years what's going to happen as T approaches sixty nine this old piece is going to approach one this whole piece is gonna approach it to zero one that one hundred divided by something that's approaching zero is approaching infinity as T approaches sixty nine years our population is going to approach infinity it's going to start the absolutely exploding does that make sense to do you get it are you seeing the math involved and understand the limit idea understanding that this is a man is so valuable it's really neat to be able to model populations like this and say hey what's gonna happen in the future are we going to go dooms there we're gonna go extinct there we're going to have a carrying capacity or limiting population and we can judge it all by the form of our function after we get after you know differential equations set up it really is modeled by that M minus P or P minus m it shows us exactly what's going to happen so I hope I've made those connections for you in the last four videos what we're going to do in the future is we're gonna talk about how harvesting and planting like stocking populations can affect our population grow so they'll be kinda interesting we're we're quite close to being done with it we'll move on to acceleration and velocity a little bit then we're gonna start talking about many years linear systems and things so a little bit back to probably what you're used to so anyway I hope you've enjoyed this so far and see some applications I'm really I'm trying to make you see that this stuff is not useless this is not just some garbage that we put on the board this is actually applicable to a lot of real life stuff so hopefully I'm making those connections are you enjoying it I hope you've enjoyed the videos I will see you for the next video when we talked a little bit more about populations of equilibrium stability stability fun holes and spouts things like that how harvesting and stalking can affected but I'll see you have a wonderful day and see you soon you
