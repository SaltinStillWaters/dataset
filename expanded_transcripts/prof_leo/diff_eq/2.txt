Transcript for: Checking Solutions in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 3)
here we go our first lesson on differential equations that involves some actual math here and we're going to start very simply we're going to start by checking whether or not a solu well an equation is a solution to a differential equation remember that differential equations involve derivatives and our Solutions are equations themselves usually y equals a function of X that's typically what we have here so if Solutions are equations well let's just take some derivatives and plug them in that's really about all there is to it is we're going to take some derivatives we're going to plug them in now if you watch the introduction to differential equations what I'm planning on doing here I'm going to do a lot of examples if you get it after the first couple examples fine just go on to the next video that's okay I I mean you're not going to hurt my feelings here um my job is to make sure well my goal is to make sure that you're understanding it if that's accomplished in the first couple examples great I would encourage you to watch them I think you'll get something out of them I usually go um up in the uh the difficulty of the problems as we get going but sometimes it just clicks so that's fine so let's start with the very first one we have y Prime which is the first derivative of y + 2 y = 0 we see immediately we've got a differential equation it's an equation it's got a derivative in it that's it this happens to be a first order differential equation because we only have a first derivative in that now it's also asking us check to see whether that guy is a solution to our differential equation all we have to do is match up the derivatives to fit them in here so what we're going to be looking at is this Y is this y we're going to take this we're going to plug it into that y but we also want the first derivative so take as many derivatives as is necessary to match up the function you're given to the differential equation that you have if you have a third order fifth order something crazy you got to take five derivatives or three derivatives respectively uh count respectively so match up the number of the derivatives plug them in see if it works that's how you check Solutions in differential equations I'm going to show you right now so this differential equ equion has a first derivative we're given a function that we're checking let's find a first derivative it says plug in the original function that you're checking anyway so remember that we have things like product rule uh we have things like quotient rule we have things like chain rule that you need to be aware of so I'm going to be doing the derivatives pretty fast I'm not going to show you all the calculus one sort of derivatives this is going to be a little quicker than that kind of counting that you understand those derivatives so here all we got is a chain rule so the first derivative of y remember we get e -2X back but we got a chain rule in there so we're going to have that -2 coming out front being multiplied by that three now we just plug these things in so we're going to take the original function put it here for y we're going to take the first derivative of the function put it for the first derivative of the function so our first derivative this -6 e -2X and then we have two times our original function that we were checking in the first place and if we put this all together it should equal zero we're just making a substitution and sure enough you could see it -6 e -2x + 6 e 2x = 0 this is satisfied we now know that that right there is a solution to that differential equation that's all there is to it uh you match up the derivatives plug them into your differential equation and go for it now I mentioned in the last video that the higher you go in order for a differential equation the more arbitrary constants you have but also the more possibility for different solutions you have as well so right now you see something funny like hey here's a second order that's y Prime second order differential equation and it says here's a y sub one and a y sub 2 what that's asking you is hey is this a valid solution check it is this also a valid solution check it it's kind of the way in math as as Math teachers can give you two problems for once twer so you had to do twice the work you have to check both of them so let's go go ahead walk through it I'm going to do y sub 1 first we'll do y sub 2 next now because we don't have a first derivative we don't have to plug anything in for that but we do have a second derivative so we're going to have to find both derivatives so we can even do this problem so y sub 1 Prime is 3 e 3x of course because we have that chain rule going on and then we do it again how we get that 3 * 3 is 9 e 3x you got to plug it in so we're going to plug in the second derivative for our second derivative the original function for original function it's immediately clear that it works so that's the idea with checking these Solutions in a differential equation let's do it with this y two I'm going to do it off to the other side the first derivative much like what we just did and he might even be able to see it like right now you go well yeah I mean if I if I plug in my second derivative remember this is our differential equation we're checking these in the these Solutions potential Solutions in if I plug in my second derivative on the left and I plug in my original function on the right it's immediately clear that both of these are solutions to that differential equation you know if you want you probably should be trying some of these if you've watched my how to study for math I know it's in the TTP videos it's like the very first one those are Universal guys so if um if you want some study tools on how to study for math one of them is really try the problems without me so if you want to take some time right now see if you can do at least Y sub one y sub 2 has a product rule so pause the video try these things out see if these are solutions to this second order differential equation give it a try I'm going to start with Y sub one right now so I know that with a first derivative and a second derivative I'm going to be taking y sub1 Prime and then y sub1 double Prime so two derivatives here and if we plug those into our differential equation that we're checking to see whether this is a solution or not it's very straightforward not much really happens here we just have plug in in the second derivative plus 4 * the first derivative plus 4 times the original function itself which is right here before we did anything to it and that needs to equal zero if this is actually a solution to that differential equation if we look at it well we have 4 e -2X we have 4 e2x that makes 8 - 8 e -2X this is going to work this is definitely a solution to that differential equation for sure hopefully you got the same thing I did that's the goal now the next one next one's a lot trickier because we have this product rule going on so even though you really don't want to do it you're going to have to do the product rule to be able to check whether that is a solution to this and you got to do it a couple times because we have a second derivative in there so let's start with the first derivative so first derivative the way I learned the way I taught it is derivative of the first times a second plus the first times D the derivative of the second so D of the first time the second plus the first times der of the second now what I mean by first and second if you forgotten this is functions of X anytime you have two functions that include X's you have to and they're multiplied together you have to do a product rule there's no other way around it so the derivative of the first function of X the derivative of this x is one plus so der of the first times the second function of X plus the first which is x times the derivative of the second so we leave the X alone we take the derivative of e2x remember we have a chain rule in there so you're going to get back the e to the -2X but the derivative of that -2X is -2 so that's our first derivative we're going to clean that up right now but that's going to be plugged in right here when we check this in just a moment so let's go ahead and take a second derivative when we take that second derivative if we clean this up a bit this is e the- 2X and then minus 2x e the2x if we um kind of multiply those those that coefficient times that variable X and now we do the second derivative so this first part's pretty easy don't make up stuff that's harder I mean this is just a subtraction we know that we can separate derivatives by addition subtraction so just take the derivative of e -2X but here we have a choice you can choose to think of the first function of X as -2X or you can think of it as 2x if you're going to think of it as 2x then you need to do a minus and you need to have a bracket because that minus sign will distribute so be very very careful on that I'm going to do it this way so I'm going to have this minus sign I'm going to completely ignore that the derivative of the first function is two plus 2X times the derivative of the second function which is e2x some of you might have thought well why aren't you just pulling out the the two here too well you could I I just forgot so either way it doesn't really matter you're going to get back the same thing so derivative of this guy no problem just chain roll here we get our product rule I left the negative out I kept the two in 2x gives us 2 e2x then we keep our 2x the Der of e2x is -2 e2x and then clean it out so we have this minus 2 e2x already minus another two because we distributed that and then we're going to get a plus this and that would give us a minus so 2 * -2 is4 but we're Distributing that which is where we get that plus from so if you're getting a lot of sign errors you're probably not doing this whole bracket thing you're probably missing your site so be careful on that one we can combine the first two terms and it looks like we're about good to go on that thing we're going to go ahead and plug that in to our differential equation we're going to see if this is true so second derivative comes first we're going to plug in this exact guy plus four times the first derivative that's way up here plus four times our original function remember we're checking y sub 2 and we are really hoping that's equal to zero otherwise we're going to think that we did some mistake up there so once we start simplifying all of this stuff the second derivative we have we plugged it in four we got a four first derivative we found our first D we plugged it in hopefully we didn't make any sign errors or anything like that our original function we've checked our original function it's right oh and I did make a mistake good thing I checked that hopeing you guys caught it before I did that would have been a major problem so we had a four and I I just didn't even see the X so the X has to be there four time x e to -2X now we can simplify and see what we're doing we always want to check our work there's a lot going on I did I made a mistake mistake but we fixed it because I checked my work so let's distribute these and let's see what's really happening let's see well this kind of nice those are gone there's 4X e -2X there's another 4 so that makes POS 8X e 2x - 8X e 2x that equals Zer so both of these end up being solutions to that differential equation I'm going to put a couple on the board right now erase the rest of it I would strongly encourage you to try the next two that I put up there for all right hopefully you've tried that or at least started it I'm going to get going on it I'm going to leave a lot of space because I don't know how long this is going to take us let's start with Y sub 1 let's check to see whether that's a solution of that differential equation it's a second order it's got a second derivative up there it also has a first derivative and the original function so we're going to start start with Y sub1 we're going to take two derivatives we're just going to plug it in so I'm going to do that now so the first derivative of y sub1 maybe I'll move this guy over [Music] [Applause] here first derivative no nothing special here I madean a derivative of natural log of x but derivative of x is 1 Dera of L and X is 1x now we take a second der derivative of one is zero but we got to be a little careful on this guy remember that this is really 1 - X1 so we're going to multiply by the exponent that's positive one we'll subtract one from the exponent and we get positive 1x2 those are the things we're going to have to plug into our differential equation let's do it now so we start with x^2 and then we see we're going to put this y Prime the second derivative which we already figured out is 1x^2 then we have x times the first derivative well that's that's this minus y well we know that Y is the original function you darn well better use some parenthesis here because we're subtracting the whole function that means we're subtracting all of this stuff and our signs are going to change and a lot of this process is just simplification doing the derivatives correctly and simplifying which is where all our correct answerers going to come from is are kind of U being really intentional about getting these this simplification correct and not rushing our way through it so x^2 * 1x2 that's 1 if we distribute we get x -1 - x + Ln X = Ln X and all of this stuff cancels and we see for sure that y y sub 1 is certainly a solution to that differential equation let's try y sub 2 again we're going to start by hopefully you know it we're going to start by taking derivatives man we got to make sure we fulfill all those derivatives up there so this will be a little bit more involved because our first term doesn't disappear like it did on y sub one with Y sub 2 on the other hand we get this let's see x to the -1 will bring down the1 that'll be x to the -2 - 1X and we sort of see this cycle that we we just did we're just going to extend it one more time here so uh -1 * x^ -2 we' bring down that -2 that's positive2 over x to the 3r + 1 x^2 for the same exact reason that we did it right there get the same exact thing so this is what we're going to be plugging in to our differential equations we're going to start with X2 again times our second derivative that's this whole piece right there then we see that we have x times the first derivative so we have our X we have our first derivative then we're going to subtract off our original function that's our y sub 2 I hope you're seeing how important those parentheses are you really need them otherwise your signs are going to be all out of whack that's going to equal lnx let's see if this actually works a lot of simplification here but we can manage that if we take x^2 and multiply that through we're going to get 2x hopefully you see it + 1 x^2 and X2 gone minus this is going to give us 1 /x and again we're going to get a minus1 then we just have to dist should be the sign and really hope that we're going to get this at the end well let's look at our ones first the ones are gone there's a plus one there's a minus one but then we have 2x - 1X - 1X well that's 2x - 2x that's zero so all of this is gone and we certainly satisfy Ln xal lnx so we know that both of these equations were solutions to our second order differential equation I want to make sure at this point that you're understanding um what Solutions are solutions are equations so these happen to be particular solutions to this they don't have that uh F that plus C that family of Curves you could easily add a plus c to either of those and uh and the differential equation would work but um these are these are these are particular here so all it takes us to do to check these Solutions is take the appropriate number of derivatives plug it in see if it works I have one more it's a little bit more advanced um I'm going to write that on the board we're going to get to it in just a minute okay so let's get started now we have a second order differential equation we have two equations that we're going to check as Solutions I am only going to do this one this is practically identical but I would encourage you to do it on your own see if you can go through those steps again one of the techniques here is don't follow your notes uh if you don't know what you're doing follow notes but once you've made it past that like after you've done these last four or five examples you really should be able to take that do exactly what's required get the right answer see if that's a solution or not it's going to be identical to the process we're doing I'm not going to waste our time to do that one so I'm just going to focus on this uh one of the reasons why we even do this is is really to get you prepped for the the level of derivatives or just remembering that hey you know we have natural log we have cosine we have S we have product rules we have chain rules we co rules all that stuff so getting us back back on track with all these derivatives and later on with all the integrals that you're going to have to master in order to even do differential equations it's not out of your realm we just have to remember it so let's go ahead let's take two derivatives of this guy and let's see what we're dealing with so y sub one and we're going to take a derivative on that and what's the first thing you see man there's a lot going on we have X we have a trig function and inside that trig function we have another X I know that a lot of you if you're not really used to it anymore want to think of this as three different functions multiplied together they're not there's only two different functions of X right now there's X and then there's cosine of Ln X so the Ln X is inside that cosine we treat that as one function this is a chain rule as opposed to a product rule be careful this is the product rule so we're going to take the derivative of the first gives us one times a second we leave that completely alone plus the first times the derivative of the second now here's where our chain rule comes in the derivative of cosine L and X is take the derivative of the first thing leave the inside thing alone and then multiply by the derivative of the inside thing that's the appropriate derivative product rule first * the second plus the first * the derivative of the second that's sin Ln x * 1X as the derivative of Ln X let's clean up a couple things about it I'm noticing that we have x * 1X those are gone and now we have to take a second derivative well we basically just have this piece in two different places I me we have cosine and sign watch your negative there on the cosine um which I didn't dang it watch your negative on the derivative of cosine and you should be fine good thing I checked that one so derivative the first that's X leave that alone the derivative of cosine is negative sign so we're going to get minus sin lnx * 1X for the chain rule good thing I caught that that would have messed everything up so we do it again derivative of cosine is negative sign we leave the lnx alone but we multiply by the derivative of Ln X to get 1/x by the chain rule next the derivative of is positive cosine of what whatever that function is we take the derivative of the inside function as per the chain rule that's pretty much it now we can Factor some things out if you want to we could factor out a negative one overx if you like we can leave it there if you want it really doesn't matter uh so these things aren't going to affect us super much let's plug them in and let's see what we have so I'm going to be plugging in sin Ln XX minus cosine Ln x/x for the second derivative I'm going to plug in this for the first derivative we plug in this for original function and let's see what happens so there's our second derivative minus our first derivative plus 2 * our original function that needs to equal zero to satisfy that that's an actual solution that differenti of equation let's see what goes on here here it looks like we're going to distribute this and get minus sin l x sin l xus x cosine L and x and here we'll distribute and get x's on both the cosine L and x and sin L and x and then here this has an X sin l x it's looking pretty good we just have to make sure for well let's see if I got my signs right I distribute this I get rid of 1x but I have a minus I distribute this I get rid of 1x but I have a minus I distribute this I have x cosine and I distribute oh I get a plus watch my minus minus plus and then I get this plus 2X cosine Ln X so if I'm looking at everything that's going on here here's a plus X sin Ln x mies with a minus here's the minus here's the plus we got that here's -1x cosine - 2 so that makes - 2x cosine Ln X and plus 2X cosine Ln X all of these are gone we get 0 equals 0 and that satisfies that this is in fact a solution to our second order differential equation try that with that one same exact routine but give it a try for yourself I hope that this has made sense it's very straightforward right now you should have a fundamental idea about what a differential equation is it's just an equation with derivatives we know that our solution our equations themselves and if we take the appropriate derivatives plug them into our differenti of equation it has to satisfy if it's going to be a solution work on those things and I'll be back with another video on how we start finding um some different types of solutions for these or how we we look at it a little differently so I'll see you for the next video
