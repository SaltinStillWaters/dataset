Transcript for: Solving Linear Differential Equations with an Integrating Factor (Differential Equations 16)
hey there let's get started some examples so last video we learned about why why how and why this this technique of solving linear first-order of differential equations works but we didn't do a lot of examples now I'm going to start going through some examples so you may be able to skip through some of these I would recommend you watch all of them and then see that you know how to do on your own that's a great study technique you can do it without your notes if you can awesome go ahead and move on if not let's go through a lot of these pretty slowly for for some of them we're gonna start build up the intensity as we move towards the end of the video so right now it's all about learning what the world we're doing so there's a few things I want you to check every time we go through one of these equations number one does it fit the technique you're trying to use if it does awesome if it doesn't can you make it fit or if it if it doesn't is there an easier way to go about it so ho if you're struggling to make it fit to fit a technique maybe there's a different way so number one okay it doesn't it doesn't fit the technique that you got if it does cool if not make it fit or if it doesn't make it fit use a different technique so let's check this out does this fit separable equations not even close no it's got X's floating around we're not even if we subtract there's no way to factor anything get our Y over so this is not separable this isn't this is linear though so does it fit linear we got a derivative it's a first derivative we have some function times y and we have known otherwise so we have Y to the first power it's already grouped with the du by DX so this is what we're looking for we wanted the first derivative based on what we want added or subtracted to some other term where you have a wine note X's or can be there or not doesn't matter but then that Y is to the first power there's no otherwise and there's only at most X's on the right hand side so this is exactly how we want these structures let's go ahead and let's solve it remember the idea you needed to watch the last video the idea is you're gonna try to complete a protocol you're gonna try to complete the result of a product rule how to do that was to realize that you need something that repeats that would be e to the function of X and the derivative the function of X has to be in this piece if you didn't watch a video you need to go watch that right now to make sure your sanity concept is I'm not going to reteach it so the plan was let's multiply by that missing piece to get this structured this way we technically we would have had to divide to get a structure this way so we're going to multiply to undo that well we multiply by is e because of e to some function repeats itself when we do a product rule e to some function whose derivative is the thing that's connected to our Y that function of X or constant in this case so if the derivative of this piece needs to give us three the integral of three needs to be that exponent whenever we do these I would start also and write down what P of X is so we first let me check hey doesn't the the format of being linear yeah does what is P of X G of X is the piece that coefficient or function of X that's connected to your Y variable the first power in this case it's just three that is the piece you're going to be integrating every time so you're always integrating the three because the derivative of that antiderivative needs to give you back three when you take the derivative of the exponential so in our case our row of X is e to the 3x done that is the piece that when we multiply is going to complete our product rule that's pretty cool you don't need a plus C here we talked about wine last video all we need to understand is that you're gonna do that e to the 3x times dy/dx because you multiply both sides it's also going to be multiplied to the middle term and to the right term now you're gonna see this a lot a lot of times things start simplifying you go wearing them who in the world would put e to the negative weight negative three point four either negative 3x in a problem you go oh yeah in the last video we learned that these are coming from when you divide by something over quickly to this if you divide by e to the 3x you're going to get that e to the negative 3x we're multiplying 2 unto that which is pretty cool so we found out that our P of X is 3 doing the integral of 3 gives us 3x why do I do that I need to be able to take the derivative of this thing get it back in both places and have the derivative of my exponent be that number right there that is what would complete our product rule for us so we still will find you're going to see that the simplest does it's a lot this is going to simplify a lot of stuff here so we have that completely gone you get 3x e to the a 3x you add exponents you get 0 we get a 0 is 1 so on the right hand side we just get two legs on the left hand side this is the the time when you want to check your work you want to check that when you take a derivative of your exponent the derivative of this piece is that number or that expression of that whatever that is because this has to be the derivative of this piece it's gotta match up never how product rules work you leave it alone one time you take the derivative in the other term that's happening that's what's going on so we have e to the 3x dy/dx plus 3e to the 3x times y and then we understand what the world happened you see we know this can look and use it if you don't understand that this is the result of a product rule you're gonna go down a rabbit trail I have no idea what I'm doing here this is the result of a product rule how product rule is work remember it's a result of an implicit derivative with respect to X so it says when you take a derivative with respect to X of this product it has to give you back this thing what's what's the product have to be when you take the derivative of a product you leave the first term alone first factor alone I would say first factor alone that's the first factor then you take the derivative of that first factor that is the derivative but then you have the derivative the second factor and you leave the second factor alone so to build your product all you have to look at do is look at this and go hey this piece right here this would not have a derivative not be a derivative you would not be taking the derivative to get this piece because this is the derivative the second piece remember how product rules work leave the first one alone derivative the second that's the first one alone then you take the derivative the first one you leave the second one that's the second one we haven't done hardly any calculus right now we haven't done an integral all we've done said because I multiplied by the missing piece the appropriate term the appropriate actor romex I now have this as the result of some product rule here how do you undo the derivative the Perl an integral undoes it so we're just going to integrate both sides with respect to what well since that's the derivative with respect to X as an independent variable we're going to integrate with respect to X now since we have an equation we do it on both sides integrals and derivatives undo each other we get e to the 3x times y equals x squared let's see we talked about why we don't need a plus C when we're doing this integral we talked about why we don't need a plus C on this one and what we do here if we have a plus C from this integral we would just add or subtract it and get a different plus C it doesn't really matter now we can solve for and I would do it right now I'd solve for C now if I had in which real value I'm not given that but here's what I would do it instead let's just solve for y whenever we're able to then I solve for y we would get x squared plus C and then e to the negative 3x and the reason why we get even a 3x we divide both sides by e to the 3x or multiply both sides by e 2 negative 3x there and you're done but that's as much as we can do so the ideas I hope it's making sense that we're trying to structure this as a the result of some module then to find the product it's so nice because each term has a factor in it that comes from our original product just find that factor it's always going to be the function of X that's before the derivative of Y it's the lies which you would have taken derivative of here times y itself because this is not the derivative of 1 put it together then any rate both sides let's go ahead and move on so first things first does it fit the technique we're trying to use well it's not separable it looks linear to me let's double check I've got a derivative of Y minus some function of x times y itself to the first power and then no otherwise anywhere else so that's linear now can we write out what the pieces are that are necessary for us to understand let's try to write out a few MX pnub X is the piece that when I take the derivative of the exponential I'm not to get I'm gonna get P of X so P of X is the thing we want to integrate to find an exponent P of X is always the function of X in front of Y with the sign so P of X would be considered as negative 2x here let's find the piece that's going to complete our product rule well we know that product rules normally have something in front here so we're gonna be multiplying we also know that if I'm multiplying in all three places because I know by both sides here that then derivative needs to repeat so the function itself and the derivative function you have the same thing in it that's creating an exponential idea the exponential also as I just mentioned needs to be the case that when I take the derivative of the exponent it gives me negative 2x okay find the integral of negative 2x that way when you take the derivative out it gives you 2x that means that our row of X is e to the well we can pull the negative 12 and get x squared so negative x squared don't need a plus C that's what we're going to be multiplying our or differential equation by all three terms of both sides all three terms that means it won't have let's see it doesn't matter what side you multiply on since multiplication is commutative so we multiply don't worry about where you're putting this I would just multiply and make sure you're doing all three of them though e to the negative x squared okay e to the negative x squared no problem e to the negative x squared don't forget the right hand side and just just stop for a second just to double-check it just really this one place is the derivative of that exponent equal to the pieces of X that you have if it is you're good to go so derivative of negative x squared is negative 2x hey there's make it to next you know that's fine simplify the rest of it sure so e to the negative x squared dy DX minus 2xy u negative x squared equals that's why e to the x squared times e to the native expert negative x squared x squared it is zero that's one and then we are going to do two steps here we're always going to show this so there's a few things we always do we always show what P of X is we always show what Rho of X is so just the integral of this no problem and put it as an exponential we always show what we're multiplying by and we always show our simplification and then we always show that this is the result of a product rule so you're going to show that this was was the result of some sort of derivative the result of some sort of derivative with respect to X of some sort of product we don't jump down here and just solve it all the way to go well yeah this comes from the product self and I do the integral we don't really do that this shows your understanding that this is the derivative with respect to X oh that's implicitly as Y is a function of X of some sort of a product and then to undo that that's where your integral comes from to show it in one big step sort of loses the technique it sort of loses the here's the math behind it I don't want that for you I want you showed a Matthew so the product itself says if this was the derivative of the second factor this is the original first factor itself if this is the derivative of the first factor this negative 2x neither negative x squared then that Y is the second factor itself so most of the time the textbook will just tell you this is always going to be that it's always going to be rho of x times y that's true and you can do math that way and not understand look about it but the reason why this is is because this piece would be the piece when you take a product rule that you're not taking a derivative of that means it's gotta be your first factor this piece is a derivative of your x stuff with the exception of the Y the Y here is not not the result of that derivative it's the piece of the product rule but you're not touching with the derivative that's why we can change this into that nice product that's why and that's why that that's just really X because of that you on the right hand side we just get 1 and now it's the time where you say oh yeah okay so if this is the result of a derivative let's just integrate to get rid of the derivative integrate with respect to X because it's a derivative with respect to X derivatives and integrals are an inverse idea they undo each other fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that then we're going to get into the negative x squared times y people is just X plus C yeah we need a plus C and if we multiply both sides by e to the positive x squared then we're going to get y equals x plus c and then e to the positive x squared and we're good that's the idea behind I do let's go ahead we'll try that last one you'll notice that this is just a little bit different because we got an initial condition up there but the idea is the same and that we want to see that it fits our technique we want to use the technique appropriately we're going to show some really pertinent stuff here so let's first check to see if it fits the technique that was great that was great this is not so great so right now this doesn't fit the format of being linear can you see why can you see why that isn't fit it's really close but we know that we want just dy/dx plus or minus some stuff that has a Y to the first power equals some stuff that is only in X's the problem here is that facts do not write down P of X I do want you to write down P of X but do not write down P of X right now you need to put it in the correct form first so we think form before we do anything else does this fit the form the answer is no we need to make it fit a linear function a linear first order differential equation if we're gonna do this technique what that means is you might have to multiply or divide to make you fit that's not a big deal just make sure you do it before you start finding P because if you have fine P now is it well that's fine and then you you integrate then you oh it's 5x they do e to the 5x it's not gonna work this is not gonna work for you so we need to make sure it's the right form that way when we integrate the P event but in that function it's giving us back the original the original function itself in terms of X and then the derivative the expert would be our P that's not the case right now so let's divide it by X so one of these have a dy/dx oh it's better already plus when you write out that second term this should always just be dy/dx the second term needs to be a function of x times y so when you write this a lot of times we make it a fraction times y I like that you don't have to put the dot but I'm just trying to show you that I don't want this all wrapped up in one fraction I want five or X to be the thing the P of X you're talking about on the right hand side feel free to simplify that that's just seven X now that's linear now it looks better now it's something I can say yeah my t of X is 5 over X can I find the missing piece the thing that when I multiply all three terms by it to complete my product rule it's going to repeat when I have the function itself and when I take a derivative of a function more than that when I take the derivative of the exponent it's going to give me this when I take the derivative the exponents when you give me this when I take the derivative of an integral of that 5 of X it's going to give me 5 or X that's how we're fighting on the row of X is that e to the X gives you back when you have the function self in the derivative function and then when I take it in the integral of 5 over X that gives me something that when it take a derivative of it gives you P of X getting planet like that so that's e to the 5 you pull out one of our exes Ln X so that would be 5 Ln X let me move our exponent up that's e to the Ln of X to the 5th this happens frequently that you'll have e to the Ln and you can walk those simplify yeah it's your do we just get X to the fifth power that is what we're going to multiply right now so when we multiply every single term both sides means distribution both sides means every single term then that row of X that's going to be the piece that when we multiply this through that's the piece that we when we did a product rule didn't get a derivative Tinian because the derivative of y we give us do my DX that means the other piece of kimber module did get touching the derivative so I have my original dy/dx 5 over x times y vibrations 1 7 X 7 X and multiplying every single term that's both sides distributive by X to the fifth that's Rho of X let's simplify what we can 5x to the fourth we don't have to worry about the right-hand side hardly at all we're only trying to make the left hand side into that product rule let's see if it worked what we need to be able to do is think about is the derivative of this giving us all the X's right here derivative of X to the fifth gives us 5x to the fourth that works that creates this result of a product rule for just you know writing so what do you need to take the derivative of with respect to X to get this we need to take the derivative of some sort of a product since that's the result of a particle how we do a product rule is we leave the first factor alone therefore that's got to be the first factor we take the derivative of the second factor okay this has got to be the derivative the second factor that's why then we take the derivative of the first factor okay this has to be the derivative here check it make sure that it is okay good and then we leave the second factor alone that's got to be the second factor that gave us that as a result of the product rule that's how this works on the right hand side 7x with six no problem if we integrate both sides with respect to because you took this as a derivative respect next to get that particle to work for you there's no work that has to happen besides your understanding of calculus and that integrals and new derivatives that means that X to the fifth times live derivatives are undone by integrals of vice-versa on the right hand side we can exit the center let's see let's see right now it would be a good time to solve for C remember with those L ends we want to kind of get rid of that rid of that wrap up the e to the C plus a minus in a bigger plus C and then use our initial value or initial condition here it's it's easier to solve receive the way it is so we're gonna go ahead and do that those new versions crazy so if I plug in 2 for X and 5 for y so we plug it in if we take two to the fifth power times fives tracked off to the seventh power we get C equals 32 let's just put that back in there so we have X to the fifth times y equals x to the seventh plus 32 and we're just going to divide by X to the fifth done that's the idea make it fit or maybe it did a different technique let's see if you can make it fit fairly easily to a technique you're trying to use in this case linear we have to divide and then we're just finding the missing piece that creates our product rule that that's pretty much about it we have lots more examples sitting on so let's go through and try a few more like we're gonna try to see that this is gonna fit linear then we're going to try to find the thing that we should be integrating that's a P of X and then multiply everything by that missing piece of crude that product rule so number one doesn't that fit linear and it's really close we have a Y to the first power but we don't have any idea DX by itself we want to make sure that that happens so we're gonna have to divide a lot of the times to make that work so let's divide everything by two X if we do that so dividing everything by 2 over X - sorry divide everything by 2 X cube is 1 over 2x we've got our Y then before we do anything else we're gonna simplify so if we can simplify this side at least then dy/dx that looks really good that's by itself we have a plus 1 over 2x no problem that's our key we have a wide on the right hand side we get 5 over the square root of x I know that's kind of improper to write that but I'm gonna leave it there because chances are that's gonna simplify whenever we find our row of x and start multiplying so now that's linear that's a first order differential equation derivative of Y some function of x times y to the first power equals some function of X no problem identify your P of X right now right now we're going to integrate that to find the exponent of Rho of X now one half right here you can pull that out so we're gonna give each to the Ln of X sure but we have a 1/2 there so the derivative of this would give us C 1 over X times 1/2 that's 1 over 2x you can do this baby it worked more sense for you well we also want to do is we want to get rid of that E&L n but in order to do so we've got to move that exponent this coefficient as an exponent so e to the Ln of X to the one half power that gives us just X to the one-half X to the one half the square root of x that's what we're going to buy so we take everything I'm people to buy both sides so every single term by the square root of x and by the square root of x and by the square by X and we get this whole square root of x dy/dx no problem plus if we simplify that we're going to have 1 over 2 square root of x equals just 5 that's gone don't worry too much about what that this looks like it's not super super important right now because all this has to be is the derivative of that piece and you think of that that is X to the 1/2 power you move down the 1/2 well that's over to you you subtract 1 from the exponent that's next to the negative 1/2 oh that's 1 over 2 square root of x that's all it's going to be that's how you check your work now the rest is so cool this right here is the result of some sort of product rule let's write that product the product as always you left that piece alone when you took a derivative you let this piece alone when you took a derivative just mash them together on the right hand side you just have 5 if we integrate both sides with respect to X then we get square root of XY equals 5x plus C and let's just multiply everything by I'm sorry divide everything by X to the one-half or multiply everything by X to the negative 1/2 either way you're going to get y equals 5x plus C times X in eighty one half if you distribute that one minus one half is just one half and then we did see time so that arbitrary constant times next to the name one if you want to write a little bit differently as suppose you can and this would not be a big deal to read like that but you could write this as 5 square root X let's see you were screwed X and you can rationalize the denominator but if you see that and you could get that one as well okay next one I'd recommend to give it a try at least the set up see it meant to awkward-looking nine but that's supposed to be a nine if you just try to at least set this up as linear take a couple seconds and do that so you'll notice it's not right now you should make it fit see if you can of course for us that means we're going to divide everything by two eggs when your thought when you're dividing everything by two x what I want you to do with your second term is a group all of your coefficients constants where you want to call those and your X's and the group that together and just put Y off to the right-hand side so I want to see this as 3 over 2x times y the reason why we're doing that we're about to multiply but that right there that is going to be the piece of this product rule you didn't take a derivative of so I want you to separate that night worry about it on the right hand side we have 9x squared over 2 now we're gonna find the missing piece to multiply by and create this as the result of some sort of product rule well right entropy of X is P of X is always the piece in front of the Y that's why we group it like that so I just said that so that you're not looking a lot of different places you could everything together and then you have your while out back this right here is your P of X when you take the integral of that that becomes the exponent of your e to read guro the e to some function X that becomes as an integral of that function just like we did before you can pull that negative three-halves out so we have negative three-halves out in front of the integral then 1 over X so that's Ln X so e to the negative 3 halves that's your constant you pull out Ln X cool let's move that as an exponent so we have e to the Ln X to the negative 3 halves power even Ln I've gone that is what we have to multiply all three of those terms by order to create the result of some sort of product rule so let's do that let's multiply everything by x2 in there you bring us let's simplify where we can so if we simplify oh yeah I said negative three times that looks fine I don't simplify that you might even be wondering why the rule do we simplify because don't you just know you didn't take this times why hello you are but you also want to check your work I'm cheery to make sure you're not doing something that's irrelevant also on the right hand side years certainly gonna want to simplify that so we have our R minus we have our three ass and then if that's a negative one this would be X to the negative five house let's see if that works just to double check is the derivative of this equal to this piece again that's why we group our X's together in the left or the right so we can check our work nicely the derivative would be bring down the negative three house got it subtract one from that hey dime on the right hand side let's see four thousands then one half to nine that's X to the one-half since we've completed that product rule or the result of a broad rule we can now really easily write out what the product was the product rule always takes one piece and doesn't take a derivative of it in one term and another piece that you don't need either though in the second term so we have to just group our row of X and our Y together done right inside nine halves X to the one half and now we can take an integral of both sides with respect to X I hope you're seeing that these don't have to take a long time they take a long time and you don't understand them then you go where are these features coming from what am I actually doing how in the world you get from here to here it's just a result of a product rule look for the pieces that you wouldn't be taking a derivative of from your product that creates your product your integral with respect to DX should be very manageable on the left hand side nothing happens your undoing a derivative with the integral you get X to the negative three house Y on the right-hand side yeah a little bit more work that's where actually most of your work is going to come from here oh let's see if we add so x to the three-halves over three-halves that's going to give us three right-hand side twos are gone 9 5 by 3 is 3 don't forget that plus C but they only have to do after that is multiply both sides by X to the positive 3 counts that's going to kill this off let's go in - you can tell that off - oh no it's not there so let's try that if we multiply both sides we would have X - 3 halves + X to the 3 halves right there this is gone you're gonna get Y on the right-hand side well what do you do when you multiply exponents together so you add them so 3 halves plus 3 halves is six paths that would be three so distributing this is going to give us 3x cubed let's see X to the three halves and that's about as good as we can get without an initial condition also be aware that a lot of times you'll have a line without an X at the very end they'll say yeah don't don't forget that you're solving this explicitly right now as a function of X so if you see that that's where that's coming from is just telling you what that is I'll be back with a couple more in just a minute let's do a couple more so first one we have a linear TTC it's linear can you see that that fits perfectly so what exactly what we're trying to do here you get a first derivative you got plus y you have a function of X there's no otherwise why is the first power looks pretty good this is fitting our linear first order differential equation perfectly let's find our P so Beks is that piece that's right in front of why in this case new bags it's just one row of X says you're gonna do the integral of whatever that P is to find the the exponent of an exponential so in our case we're just gonna get e to the X that right there is that piece that you're gonna multiply by you complete your product rule and yeah I'm trying to kind of brainwash you right now I'm saying the same thing over and over and over again because we have lots of techniques and lots of stuff and it's easy to forget this stuff I'm trying to get you use of the format and you still what it is you're doing is if you understand what it is and why it works you're less likely to make mistake most like you forget it so we're trying to complete a product rule by finding something that repeats and something that wouldn't take a derivative of the exponent it's going to give us back the thing that's multiplied on the Y so let's multiply that's dy/dx plus y equals e to the X and we're going to multiply everything times even the X now we're going to double check our work okay well is the derivative of this thing equal to the piece that's being multiplied the Y yes and now we can keep on going we know that we've completed the result of a product rule with respect to X implicitly result of the product rule says you left the first one alone you left the second one alone in the second term on the right hand side you have let's see e to the x times e to the X that's e to the x squared multiply exponents e to the 2x now we're ready to do an integral because we know this was the result of a product product rule of a derivative respect to X we do an integral with respect to X right hand side no problem it's a u sub e to show you so we'd have u equals 2x to be if you take the derivative so we have 1/2 e to the 2 u and sure enough the derivative this could just either 2x times 2 which would give her that 1/2 let's see on the right-hand side really nothing happens if we divide everything by e to the X we would get 1/2 e to the now imagine this u divided by e to the X this is e to the x squared so you're going to get e to the X plus C e to the negative X or C over e to the X if you have initial conditions you'd want to plug them in here a little bit easier to solve so when you get down to finding two undoing your new derivatives if we wanted to plug that in there like Y of zero equals one you'd want to do it here so X would equal zero Y would equal one so that would be C would it be 1/2 so if you want to try that in your own we'd have e to the 0 times 1 you can see this is 1 subtract 1/2 you get C equals 1/2 and we can leave it just like that the next one I'm not actually going to do for you because I want you to look at what's going on to do this with as a linear differential equation would require a lot of work that's not how I want you to think so yeah this can possibly be in your do this linear' and if you have to you have to and I'll talk about that for a second I suppose but do you see that that is separable but why in the world what do we make this harder than it is if you can make this 1 over 1 minus y dy equals cosine X DX which you obviously can and agree that's pretty darn easy that that was not a lot of work I'll show you what money would require of you and you can do it on your own see actually I'm gonna courage I'll see if you can do it on your own just me so that would be negative sine X minus C little recap of separable equations I suppose 1 minus y would equal remember we have e to both sides we have e to the negative C times B to the negative sine X I drop my absolute value in the plus and minus we wrap this whole thing up into a gigantic C I'd want to plug in my initial condition here so if we plug that in then 1 minus 2 equals C e to the negative sine of PI sine of pi is 0 e to the 0 is 1 1 minus 2 is negative 1 C equals negative 1 and when we put that back up here we would get 1 minus y equals negative 1 e to the negative sine X let's subtract 1 and if you divide everything by a baby here we get one plus e to the negative sign X then that's not that bad that wasn't a whole lot of work if we try to do it differently if we try to do it linear I would just see the difference here so that was separable that's fine that gave us the right answer the same as I'd answered if you had to do this linear you'd have to distribute we have to get the cosine XY on the opposite side so we have to groove our Y's together basically then you have to say okay well what's my P my P is cosine X my Rho will be e to the integral cosine X that's 9x and we would multiply it every single on on both sides every single term so we have it's going to do it separately we'd have e to the sine X and then e to the sine X and most importantly e to the sine X on the left hand side this is not a problem this would say okay yeah you're going to have a derivative with respect to X of e to the sine X Y which of course the derivative of either sine X gives you cosine X be the sine X you're not a problem on the right hand side you're going to have to take the integral of cosine X needed sex this side easy derivatives gone this side take an integral with strength eggs we get e to the sine X y equals well that's a new so and that I mean you can see already there's a lot more work here that already introduces something that I don't really want to have to deal with I don't have to deal with it so you take a u equals sine X I completely lie to you by the way stem I can do this not totally doing it because I can't help it cosine X DX so e to the U would be e to the sine X and you can see that that's the derivative of this gives you that right there so we get cosine actually the sine X plus C and we will plug in our pi/4 x and our two for for uh for y we would get that this would equal that's that's to minus one of the CC would equal 1 so C would equal one here that tells us that I know we're kind of run into the problem we get it I'm gonna do two things I'm gonna tell you that C is one I'm also going to tell you that to get rid of e to the sine X even multiply everything by e to the negative sine X that would give you Y that would give you one that would give you one times e to the negative sine X and that's exactly what that is which way is easier the way that makes sense in this case of both of them work but is something fits simpler technique or something fits without having to modify it you should probably use that technique right here there's no reason why we wanted anything else besides linear right here there's no reason why we should do anything else our side separable that was easier I think that was easier to get to here I had it shown to this a lot but it is possible to make that into a linear so whatever technique makes sense to you but generally speaking it's the one you don't have to do as much work with the one that you want to modify to make it fit sometimes there's exceptions to that but in general that's what you're looking for so let's try two more I'm honestly I would like you to try that one on your own at least as far as identifying whether or not you have a linear first-order differential equation that one's weird so I'll talk about that one together but see if you can see if that's linear if it is can you done with my P can you do that can you see if you can do the integral of the P and put that as an X 1 on e e to some function of X for Rho can you multiply everything by that give it a try possibly if you can just see if you can do it and if not nobody do so learning it so together yeah that's linear that's first order derivative of y plus some function of x times y to the first power equals something that doesn't have lies in it that's what we're talking about now that we have it in proper form we find P of X well P of X is the factor that's attached to Y that's Co tailor the thing that's going to complete our result of a product rule is always an exponential and the exponent is an integral of P of X now we talked about that at length on why that works that way so I would use your table use your your integration take these whatever it takes to do that integral quickly that is Ln of absolute value sign X so if that is Ln a of a site X well then e ln Argan and we just get that this is equal to sine X and that's what we're going to be multiplying all three terms by so we'll have sine X dy/dx plus y times cotangent X times sine x equals cosine Oh time Silex now we do like to simplify quite a bit because right now you go hey the derivative sign X is not this yeah that's that's true the group of sine X is cosine X so let's see if that makes cosine X remember cotangent is cosine over sine well that gives you just cosine X so let me simplify things are a little bit more apparent to us so sine X dy/dx no little problems plus well we could have cosine X times y equals sine X cosine X derivative this gives us that and that's how you check this that that's how the product rule works so this came from some derivative with respect to X of a product rule where we let the first term alone on the first sorry first factor alone the first term the second factor alone on the second term and that gave us an equation a differential equation where the right side is exactly that now when we integrate with respect to X because that's what we took the derivative way these are gone we get sine x times y on the right hand side you probably have to use a u sub u equals I would pick u equals sine X that way the derivative the sine X is cosine X so we would just get u squared over 2 or 1/2 u squared so that would be 1/2 sine squared X plus C and if we let's see we have to divide when we so divide by sine of X hopefully you thought that you would equal sign do you let's take the derivative that sine X DX so this would be the integral of u du u this whole thing is to you that get us the one-half U squared and then you just put sign right back in there that's how I'm getting that I'm just doing a lot of in my head I probably should have done that sorry so we'd have 1/2 sine squared X plus C if we divide everything by sine X well we get 1/2 sine X is U divided sine square divided by sine but you also get plus C over sine X so dividing everything by sine X let's just make that better we know that 1 over sine X is cosecant so let's write that it's come seeking there's a little review of trigonometry for you and that's what we want to see so we did our basic integral again but most of the work is done right hand side left hand side just calculate along you have a set technique for that and then we solve for y so divided by sine X square divided by sine X gives something X C divided by sine X gives us cosecant X that's the idea so the next one and that thing doesn't look anything like how we want it to be oh yeah all right well I mean the lease it's got a first order derivative for sort of differential equation but it's not separable you got four terms of there I don't see how I'm gonna be able to give it to Weiss what's going on with that if you're gonna try to make this linear you have the Y in two places you're gonna have a factor so let's try to factor this and since there's four terms maybe click so we go oh let's see if we can factor by grouping don't you try that now see if you remember that's factor by grouping we're gonna be first grouping factor by grouping groups the first two that says what can you factor out that as far as a GCF nothing nothing means one grouping always brings down your middle term groups the last one says one can you factor out of that as far as a GCF what and if you have two terms with the same factor you can keep on going factor 1 plus X what remains is one plus one let me ask you is there any way that you wouldn't do that with the separable equation why wouldn't you do that with separable equations you can divide both sides by 1 plus y leave the 1 plus x squared is move the DX so I would certainly do it that way of course if you're trying to do by bilinear you don't make it that far so this right here this would be done if you could if it's possible you do it by separable equations I'm not going to go through that I'm gonna go back one step that's how I would recommend trying to go yep that's separable see if you can move one over one plus y one over one plus X and maybe written in size to do linear can't leave it there why well I told you that you need some function of x times y when we factored this we've got Y times that function this is kind of irrelevant let's move this to the left hand side let's group our wise okay if we do that we'd have dy DX we subtract 1 plus x times the Y on the right hand side we still have 1 plus X well now that we've written this as linear so hopefully you learned that there's on some of these there's more than one technique available that happens quite a bit I would have picked it acceptable at least to try it if we ran to a problem then we go back into linear so if you're practicing linear I'm going to show you where that happens so I'm gonna try it separable if that didn't work then I come back here and okay let's try our linear I can go back one step and say yep I can subtract the thing that has our only Y on the left hand side group our dy/dx and or Y term the right hand side we have an X term and then we can identify what P of X is P of X it's always the piece that's right for live role of X says you're gonna get this exponential where the exponent is the integral of your P of X because when you take a derivative that don't give you back your P of X so if we take the integral of that it looks really nasty but we have e to the negative X plus 1/2 x squared integral of 1 is X integral of X is x squared over 2 so 1/2 x squared we have a negative out front unfortunately that is what we have to multiply all of this crap line why did I just pick separable so I let that big spot for what we're about to multiply by so I'm going to multiply everything by my row so e to the negative x plus 1/2 x squared and e to the negative x plus 1/2 x squared and e to the negative x plus 1/2 x squared now the left hand side is always very nice all you have to do is check it is the derivative of this piece equal to this piece well the truth here would be 1 plus X and then it has a negative so yep that works so we can take all of that and say hey that's the result of some product rule where I had this piece times this piece and we know it's got to equal this piece then we take an integral the left-hand sides basically done for a snowy deal on the right hand side you didn't need to do so so when we do a usin and we say let's just let u equal the inside so the nasty buddy then we see that the evening was one to take the derivative derivative of X is wandering 1/2 x squared gives us X when we go okay do u equals 1 plus X DX that's this whole piece but just notice we did not include the negative with that choice of U so this would equal the integral of e to the negative you can you be careful with your signs be careful then left hand side we're gonna leave that alone for just a minute right hand side we get negative e to the negative u plus C but we know when u is negative the exact same exponent this is the time where you would want to find your C so if we plug that in we would have this gives us 0 so 0 plus 0 e to the 0 is 1 this becomes 0 still hold upside to 0 on the right hand side you would have 0 + 0 at 0 e to the 0 is 1 that's negative 1 so C equals 1 0 equals negative 1 plus C else equals 1 and let's let's go ahead and let's put that in there because now what we're going to multiply by and you might be been wondering why am i leaving that negative out there well this happens a lot happens that when you get to the end or interior substitution these things work nicer without distributing that we multiply everything by e to the positive version of this that would create one so just Y negative one and then e to the positive exponent there so multiply everything by e to the positive exponent gone this whole thing's gone times negative one you want plus one times the positive exponent and that's about as good as we can get on that one you might want to write that in different order so you could have e to the X plus 1/2 x squared and then plus or minus one to end no big deal but that's the idea is it's this all the stuff that works but sometimes you kind of want to check what what the format of your what technique would work best in this case I would have certainly tried separable equations first okay let's try another one this has some more advanced ideas on what we can do so let's try to make it fit we're gonna go quickly through it I told you they're going to look more advanced we're gonna go quick because the technique should be there so number one doesn't fit no make it fit linear if we can so let's divide everything by X we're also going to want to make sure that we group our X's in front of our why cuz that's going to be our P and we're gonna simplify well 2x over X gives us 2 minus 3 over X let's treat that as our P equals 4 X cubed then we use find our P and do the angelou that it's a little bit more manageable than something ridiculous like this that would be kind of difficult to do we'd be doing this anyway so P of X is 2 minus 3 over X Rho of X says take your exponential do an integral of P of X see what that does to give us 2x minus 3 Ln X so integral of 2 is 2x minus integral of 3 over X is 3 Ln X we know we can move that exponent up and we can also separate this so we can do e to the 2x times e to the negative I'm sorry yeah ok so e to the negative Ln of X cubed well we can also move this and as this make that an exponent you can multiply you're gonna get X to the negative third power we could have done it right from here too you can see the same thing move the negative 3 up an ad that's fine tunas we're not we didn't either the 2 x equals e to the Ln of X to the negative 3 those times those are gone we have e to the 2x over X cubed y over X and negative third power gives us 1 over X cubed so you have the 2x times X in a 3rd power get is neither 2x over X cubed that's our rhythm let's take that let's multiply we now Miller we're completing that that pro tool on a on a product let me take a derivative lots of things are going to simplify on the right-hand side so we have execute is completely gone where's Jamie for either the two eggs we would double check this but man that's that's a product rule with a negative so you if you distribute this and you figured that out the derivative of this is that thing that's crazy but you should work that out we know that this is the result of a product rule a product rule of a derivative with respect to X where we take the first factor and left it alone for the first term the second factor in left alone for the second term and if we do an integral on both sides now you're not going too fast for you I hope that made sense it's a same technique this is you getting a little bit more advanced so we the P can look funny that's not everybody um when we do an integral of that don't forget that you can split up fractions don't forget that we have an e to these things you can split up those that he has a product of either whatever those those those things are those sorry terms are and we know that negatives and coefficients moobus exponents we can simplify each of Ln no problem that's our road that I don't care what you have that's which you're multiplying every single piece by and that's what we've done we simplified where we could and we know that this is the result of product or right the product after that we do our integral we get e to the 2x over the next few times y equals is a u sub if you'd like this is going to be 2 e to X let me know that because when you take a derivative of this we would get back the exponential times 2 on that 2 so that would give us that 4 plus C and lastly all we need to do is solve for y so multiply everything by e to the negative 2x or divide everything by e to the 2x so this and this and that's going to get me in the negative x and we'd also multiply by x cubed so basically multiplying by the reciprocal in this so why would you roll we'd still never - but you no longer have an e to the 2x when you distribute you just have X cubed well we're doing both of them on the scene that's about as good as we can do on that problem okay last one and I just want to talk about this because the setup is so strange whenever you get something looks really weird like man it's almost linear but there's a Y over here you're going to have to factor do the factoring first before you divide your lot easier on you so what I mean by that and this is just a set up I'm not I'm gonna do about a quarter of the problem and you can try it on your own we want to get their Y's on the same side so we subtract that and it is okay to get 0 in fact in this problem when you after you figure out you're you're the product to get the product rule you're going to be integrating the right side it's going to be zero no matter what you multiply by do you see that no matter what you multiply by you're going to get zero so the integral is zero just gives you zero Aurel actually gives you see a constant let's see so don't worry about that get your Y's together and factor and then you can divide everything by X so when you divide by X we get dy/dx we get one plus one minus three x over X and we would still get zero it's okay to by zero by X split that up just like the previous problem and then you're gonna be all set so we would get 1 over X minus 3 it's been look so similar to last probably your P of X is this you take the integral of that given Ln X you should see that that will cancel you'll get just X minus 3x so you have either to negative 3x multiply all three spots just don't forget that when you do integral the right hand side this is for you when you didn't integral the right hand side you're gonna get a constant that's where your C is that's about it I hope this makes sense that when you have two y's you're gonna have to factor alright guys I hope the video makes sense I'll see you for the next one ok just kidding I couldn't leave it and I had to I had to do it so anyway I worked it out and this is just the answers for you so if that's your P I integrated the P I separated from my row made it a lot nicer I multiplied everything here and here and here which still gave me a zero I created my product it's very easy to do just take this piece put a wine next to it that's your product can degrading both sides integral of 0 gives you C and then solve for y so that's what you should be getting that's what you should have gotten all right now let's see the next video you
