Transcript for: Reducible Second Order Differential Equations, Missing Y (Differential Equations 26)
hey it's time to talk about something new so so far we've really only had techniques that have worked with first-order differential equations or very very very special second-order and this is this is one of those times too but we're gonna do a certain to this technique so what we're getting in this class is we are gonna start talking about some applications in a few more videos and then ask that we're going to talk about how we can how we can deal with higher order differential equations so we're we're about to get there again videos before that but right now it's kind of this this thought like are there techniques to deal with higher order differential equations yes of course there are and this is one of them so how we can deal with some second-order differential equations differential equations have a second derivative of Y with respect to X in them can we deal with them and the answer is sometimes a lot of times if there are certain form definitely this is one of those forms so when we have something that we call a reducible second-order differential equation we need know what that means and then we need to know how to work with it so what reducible means is that we can make a substitution and in making this substitution typically a variable that represents the first derivative okay if the variable represents the first derivative then the derivative of that variable would represent the second derivative and then second derivative looks like a first derivative first derivative like a variable okay we reduced it one order into a first order differential equation that we can work with but there's only a couple cases that actually work so when's it work this works if we have a second order differential equation where we are missing a variable completely we're missing Y or where we're missing X and there's two different cases and we're going to talk about both of those cases you might wonder well what about the two cases there's no third we'll talk about that so when we have a second order differential equation that we are missing the Y variable I don't mean Y to the first power Y to the second power I mean just the function of so I said everyone not the first derivative second derivative why I mean just the function of Y itself we're missing the function of Y or when we're missing the function of X I'm not talking about missing Y the derivative of Y I'm talking about Y itself I'll see that we'll talk about it but that's when we would call these a reducible first order difference of the clay I'm sorry reducible second order differential equation when we can call the first derivative a variable then the derivative the first variable represents the second derivative of Y and we could replace both of them to reduce it by an or that's the idea to use one of the techniques we already know how to deal with that's what we're looking to get out of it so we're gonna take a look at it what to do and then how to do it so what to do why this works what's gonna happen here we're going to talk about just missing the Y variable first in this video and next we will talk about when what happens when you miss an X video a X variable so when we get we look at it what if we were to call D by DX so the first derivative of Y with respect to X just a very very well then if he represents the first derivative of Y with respect to X then wouldn't the second derivative of Y be represented as the derivative of P with respect to X I mean shoot if P represents the first derivative then the derivative of P would represent the second derivative and that's exactly what we're gonna do and you go we'll wait a minute it's that easy yep that's it if Y is missing it's that easy what about otherwise I mean we don't you have to have a substitution for y no that's the whole point I gone so if Y is gone we don't have to replace Y with anything that's why this technique works so we say okay call the first derivative P then the second derivative is the derivative of P that's it if the first derivative is P itself the derivative of P would represent the second derivative of Y that's a yeah now what about X go I'm not dealing with it in this this video but the next one that will well we do the same thing we go okay well then then why crying what equal dpdx sure but if my ex is gone then that with respect to X is really hard to deal with and so we do something else we say okay let's sound let's use a little bit of the chain rule idea and say deep if we can write DP DX as DP dy times dy DX oh whoa okay so hang on hang on dy DX is P then we can write the second derivative of Y as P DP dy because this should not alignment that's the idea so if Y is gone it's easier a little bit easier to see you just do a straight-up substitution if X has gone a little bit more involved we have some P times DP dy which gives us the third case what if both of them are gone what what if you don't have an X and you don't have a why choose this one most of the time because it's a little bit easier so if you have a choice between them and both x and y are gone you just have the derivatives of Y up there choose that one a little bit nicer most of the time so that's what I'm gonna encourage you to do so case three is what the book done so anyway let's go ahead and give this a try this is the idea and hopefully it's making sense of what we're doing a man if you if you're missing a lie you don't have to replace the Y with anything let's call the first derivative a variable then the second derivative is just the derivative of that variable it's going to reduce the the order of our derivatives by one same similar something similar for X's but we have to deal with the fact that X is gone and so we're gonna have a little bit of manipulation here to say okay the first derivative is P greater the second derivative is P times DP dy and we'll deal with that in the next video let's give this one a try so is it reducible is it is a differential equation is this second-order differential equation that happens to be reducible where you start using some Prime's here because when we get to higher derivatives it's very cumbersome right to everywhere and three everywhere and seven everywhere if we get to that so we deal with a lot of these crimes or when we get to higher derivatives and you write a third derivative we write it like that so that's a notational convention that we're going to use pretty much from here on out when we do with these higher derivatives so Y double prime says the second derivative of Y minus is the first derivative why is it a second-order differential equation is it reducible well is it missing a very warm yeah it's missing the variable Y it has the variable X so we're gonna try to do a substitution I don't want you just following rule so once you understand it if we can do this and say hey let's just call ki the first derivative of Y with respect to X alright well then what's what's y double Prime what's the second derivative then the derivative of P with respect to X would equal the second derivative of Y with respect to X or Y double prime that gives us a very very nice substitution that we made so are we still gonna have an X of course but this changes to x times the second to L look P was the first derivative the derivative of P with respect to X is the second derivative so y double prime is DP DX y prime itself well my prime stands for the first trip that's just P that that's it do you notice what it does if you call the first derivative of variable then the derivative of that variable is the second derivative it's reduced the order of this differential equation by one now so notes for you do not forget to substitute back in you're gonna have a P floating around you have to deal with that and then you have to do another integral so do not forget about that and then secondly because we have a second order differential equation you should end with two arbitrary constants we're doing integration twice on two different things and so we're gonna get that so let's take a look at it now we have x DP da okay so our sort of first order differential equation now is in terms of a dependent variable P with an independent variable X it's separable let's separate this so that means that we can group our P's DP and our X DX we'll talk about domain a little bit you're gonna hear this quite often but a lot of times you're gonna hear assume X or Y or these variables to be positive we're convenient or necessary or something along those lines and so they don't even write it I think he should we don't have to write greater than zero here but we certainly need to make sure that we understand that your first derivative can't be zero that would I mean you'd have a constant there for your life it was so but your first trivet can't be zero but we definitely don't want to say that X can't be 0 but you're gonna hear that a lot like assume these conditions to be positive where necessary or convenient well okay so let's see second rule the first derivative is a variable second derivative is the derivative of that variable no problem separable claim we got PDP get 1 over X DX let's integrate both sides on the left hand side we'll get Ln absolute value of P on the right hand side we'll get Ln absolute value of x plus C sub 1 well it's kind of nice let's let's solve for P now here's the point you're gonna have to solve for P or have something that's going to be decent because you're going to replace p with what P equals which is the first derivative of Y so that P is going to become your first derivative you're gonna have to do another integral and so we want to solve for P as much as possible so that our integrations easier well what that means is that we're gonna take the DS as exponents on e so e to the and e to them well that it gives us absolute value P equals do you remember it this would be e to the Ln absolute value of x times e to the C sub 1 we don't composition inverse functions we're going to get just absolute value of X but we can also do this we can also say let's wrap up those absolute values as plus and minus B to the C sub 1 times just X all of this right here can be your Barba trade constant now I'm gonna leave it for just a bit I'm gonna it's gonna look kind of nasty but I'm gonna leave that there for just a bit to show you what's gonna happen at the very very end so can you write this as C sure you can't and you know why I guess it doesn't really matter if we do or not it doesn't it doesn't super matter if you want to write that as C right now fine but we're gonna be changing it again later so I'm gonna leave it there now the point of all this the point is that well the census is a first order differential equation it was fairly easy to solve but now we understand that it was reducible we're gonna kind of have to unreduced it we're gonna have to say well he represents something don't forget to sub soup I can't you mean your variable here is not P that you want to solve for its Y so if P represents the first derivative that's the substitution we made it yielded this substitution so we're able to do both like this double substitution idea we've been dealing with it for a long time but now that it reduced the order we solved it now I understand P means dy/dx you go oh wow that's still separable actually if we think about this as a group you're wise be wise and your X is DX that's a really nice separable difference relation or you can think about it this way you can think about it as that's basic integration you could just integrate both sides right now with with respect to X that's fine well we do and we integrate let me say okay then on the left hand side we get Y on the right hand side we get plus or minus e to the C sub 1 X plus C sub 2 well I'm sorry x squared over 2 plus C sub 2 so integral of 1 dy is y integral of this whole thing is a constant so constant we have X to the first power add 1/2 by my new constant that's plus or minus e to the C sub 1 over 2 and then plus C sub 2 this is why I said we're gonna get two arbitrary constants here you're getting great once you get an arbitrary constant it's still in there you integrate again you're going to get my another arbitrary constant it's still in there so I mentioned something a little while ago that we're gonna change this again this is the reason why I didn't change it at first it's because I'm gonna wrap this whole thing up in a constant could you have just said let's make this C sure and then this whole thing is C not a problem and this whole thing is C not a problem this whole thing is C yeah but you're gonna have to wrap this up in a different seat so if you wanted to do this I would suggest calling a C sub 2 C sub 2 C sub 2 C sub 2 and then the C sub 3 that way we get y equals C sub 2 over 2 x squared plus C sub 3 now I want to tell you one more thing we're gonna wrap this up is another arbitrary constant and this is going to happen a lot in in these reducible second-order differential equations that they represent families of curves with two arbitrary constants so most of the time you'll see them a and B so instead of C sub anything with these subscripts you'll say Alice let's just call this C sub 2 over 2 let's call that an arbitrary constant a and then C so let's call it an arbitrary constant B and you're gonna see that an awful lot what that means is that's that family of curves let's see those are parabolas so those are cratylus upper open downward-opening narrow or wide that are on they have a vertex on the wax it's shifted up and down isn't that interesting so this second order difference equation the result of the solution of that is a family of curves that are all parabolas very kind of neat I hope you understand the technique that we're going to do for more examples there get a little bit more involved here this is the most basic that I could I could get but the idea is replace the first derivative with a variable that automatically reduces the order then the derivative of that variable represents the second derivative of your of your why replace them typically a bit very nice integral just don't forget that this is second order so when you figure out the first differential equation you've got to solve for dy/dx and do it again or find some other technique to be able to do it again let's move on and check out another example let's learn about two more of these so let's take a look at our second order differential equation and we look at and go okay I don't know how to deal with those so unless they're super easy and we just integrate twice no problem but if they're reducible then I can reduce the order of this differential equation by one do the integral then do it again and so what we're looking at is this idea that these are reducible if we have X missing or Y missing there's two different cases in this case we're looking to go hey why is missing that's the nicest case because that's a direct substitution if we replace the first derivative with a variable P then the second derivative would be the derivative of that P with respect to X the same variable so first derivative we'd call that a variable then the second derivative is just the derivative of that variable very nice substitution let's go ahead and do that now so we're gonna leave everything else but we're gonna replace the second derivative Y double prime with the derivative of P because we can replace Y prime first derivative with P itself so X no problem DP DX no problem plus the derivative of Y the derivative of y respect X is P we do Forex what does it look like to you genius does it look like a first order what technique fits in best well it looks linear because we have this dpdx we have P to the first power we have a function of X no other P's and not separable can I do it linear is don't you have to divide by X no you know what I mean no after you divided by X you would get 1 over X here you'd have e to the Ln of sorry e to the Ln of 1 over X sorry e to the 7 alone you have e to the Ln X e to the Ln X would give you X you multiply X back you get exactly the same thing this right here is actually the result of a product rule already look at that the derivative of P with respect X the X alone the derivative of X is 1 leave the P alone that's the result of a product rule so even if you want you know I'll show to you if you wanted to go through and divide this I'm gonna race this but divide everything by X of course X would have to be nonzero or you get a greater than zero so it's positive we're convenient we go right well e to the Ln X because integral of 1 over X DX gives you Ln X that would give you X let's multiply that X gone X BAM it's the same exact thing so even if you use an integrating factor the integrating factor would be X the thing that you're dividing by it would be the ingredient that you put right back it's like that first time I ever showed you linear I said if you've got a divide you're right now you're dividing by that piece you're trying to find let's not do that so this whole left side that's the result of a product rule where you would have X and P notice leave the first alone derivative the second derivative the first thing the second alone that's it that's a little product rule very cool on the right hand side we just have 4x it's ready for us all we've got to do is take an integral on both sides with respect to X we're gonna do that now level 1 works out like that and girls derivatives awesome we get x times P right hand side we would get well let's see for X add 1 to the exponent divide by the new exponent that would be 2 x squared plus C sub 1 that's our first arbitrary constant that also mentioned well you you probably should get P by itself if you can so let's divide by X keep it in mind that X can't be 0 for us to do that that's important so what do we do what do we do now so after we have this well taken care of as far as our first-order difference equation plot and substitution we need to understand that you cannot forget to resub stitute this means something this means the derivative of Y with respect to X so if P equals this and this represents the solution to the first derivative now thankfully if we're able to solve for P this is typically something very simple so that's something to go okay yeah derivative Y this Rex all I'm gonna do is integrate that if I want to move my DX think about this more like a differential form cool if not take it to an integral right now with respect to X on both sides either way works so let's write this as separating this set bull equation in its most basic sense let's take an integral on both sides this would be y equals okay that's x squared plus C sub 1 is a constant but we do get Ln X if we don't make the restriction that X's has to be greater than zero well then we've got to show that there's an absolute value if you do make that restriction you can omit the absolute value plus C sub two man that looks looks pretty nice the only other thing that we've got to do is it's not super great to write C sub 1 6 & 2 all the time and it's not it's not a problem it just looks a little bit cleaner to write this as x squared plus a Ln absolute value X close to me what's the idea if we're missing Y if we're missing the variable Y that second-order differential equation is reducible we call the first derivative a variable the second derivative would be the derivative of that variable very nice so use a technique to solve the first order differential equation that's the result of that substitution and then replace that P don't looking like that with the first string and basically do it again you shouldn't it with two arbitrary constants either C sub 1 C sub 2 5 or 8 and B's it does not matter that's a bad that's about it the only other thing I always say is watch your domain restriction so if you wanted to not have to deal with absolute value you'd have to define that differently just be careful with it okay let's look at the second one why don't you try it right now take a minute and just write out what substitution we work I'm gonna race this for just a second but I want you thinking is it a differential equation obviously is it a first-order second-order obvious it's a second-order is it is it missing a variable which means it's reducible once missing why oh great if it's missing why then I can straight up do a substitution for the first derivative and then the result of the derivative that the second derivative so let's call our first derivative P and then the second derivative would be the derivative here with respect to X do our substitution so this is your x squared no problem second derivative is DP DX plus 3x the first derivative is just P and we haven't - isn't that nice man it's so nice level works when it works out like that oh yeah what now well now it's a first order differential equation what's it look like to you it doesn't look separable not like the other ones it looks linear it looks like this one as far as is linear though because we have a DP DX we have add function of x times P in the first no other P's function of X over here or at least a function over there that has involved peas or Y is there anything obviously not Y's are gone so let's try to write this as the linear that it represents so let's divide everything by x squared so this isn't an easy last one when we had that really obvious product of result of applaud what was your nice we're probably gonna have to use our integrating factor here let's go ahead and do it so one thing we'll want to note on the on our work somewhere I don't keep bringing this this up but when you divide by X you you cannot have the X be 0 so we're going to write that but since our an integrating factor if we don't want to deal with that absolute value we're gonna say let's just make X greater than 0 and you that that takes care of the dividing by 0 we don't have that and also takes care of we don't need absolute values so that that's kind of it's very nice and you're gonna see a lot of times as I mentioned that we're convenient right X positive or something so it happens quite a bit okay well now that we have our X's it's our sorry 3 over X being our our RP next to our P well don't worry about that think about the function of X that's gonna be the exponent of our integrating factors so when we do our row racks are gonna create a factor here we have e to the integral of 3 over X or 3 times integral of 1 over X that gives us e to the three Ln X that gives us e to the Ln of X cubed and so that gives us just execute I hope that these are all the stand on issues at this point that you really understand any vector who done just a ton of them let's take that X cube let's multiply it everywhere so we had a DP DX we had a 3 over X and a P and 2 over x squared and we're gonna take an integrating factor of Rho of X in this case do you use integrating factors other places yeah so I can't say this is the integrating factor but it's an integrating factor that we're using here so we're gonna multiply by X cubed and X cubed and X cubed all by distribution on the left hand side this simplifies to 3x squared hey look derivatives is this perfect this simplifies to just 2x so we have the result of a product or a where a product would be X cubed times P on the right hand side we've just got two eggs that's really nice because we can just do a straight-up integral on the right hand side looks really easy on the left hand side same thing as long as we were with respect to eggs so we're gonna get this X cubed times P on the right hand side we have x squared plus C sub 1 let's solve for P as much as possible as divided by X cube so if we divide by X cube we're gonna get 1 over X but we're also going to get C sub 1 over X cubed so let's see next guess 1 or X over X Q okay fantastic now the reason why we solved for P is because if we can do that obviously I mean hopefully it's obvious to you that if you solve for P then when you replace p with what it actually represents with this dy/dx it automatically makes something business-ready to integrate for us it's already there so we're going to do that we're going to say dy is this one over X plus C sub 1 over X cubed DX when we integrate both sides with respect to X we get Y on the right hand side hey that's kind of nice only two fractions this is Ln X we don't need absolute value mainly made this domain restriction and then we have well let's see this would be C sub 1 X to the negative 3 so I'm going to add 1 to that that's C sub 1 X to the negative 2 over negative 2 plus C sub 2 so we're trying to be careful here watching our signs so Ln X - looks like C's that you know what on the lead of LM leave it plus plus C sub 1 over negative 2 times 1 over x squared C sub 2 why am i doing that I'm doing that because I know when I wrap this whole thing up as an arbitrary constant probably a and I don't want to have - as if I don't have to and then I have a cease of - hanging on the back so we have this a line X perfect we have a leisure constant 1 this they go to divided by the new coefficient let's see 100 negative 2 that's going to be wrapped up as another constant plus C 2 so if we want to write this a little cleaner we def Ln absolute value of x + let's call that a so we have a times 100 x squared that's 8 over x squared + mean and you can write that different orders but that's about all we get out of it I hope it's making sense this idea hopefully you're getting it what we're doing right now it should start being very straightforward in your head like yeah I totally get it that the first group is a variable second derivative would be represented by the derivative of that variable then undo the first order resultant differential equation and then just integrate again and you're gonna get two arbitrary constants I'm gonna come back with two more examples we got three to do if there's one example you should really focus on it's this one this has a lot of really good stuff in it for you - no is it basic it looks basic it doesn't end up being all that basic so why don't prime or second derivative let's try to expose x equals x plus y prime for supervisor spec 2x all quantity squared you go okay hey it's its second order is it reducible well let's look is it missing a variable yeah it's missing the variable Y can I make a basic substitution yes I can let's go ahead let's call the first derivative P that way the second derivative is DP DX no problem let's go ahead and let's replace that so the second derivative that's gonna be DP DX on the right hand side you don't replace your exes when you do replace your first derivative remember with every substitution every instance of Y has to be replaced so pull apart derivatives of both of our derivative of Y with respect to X have to be replaced thankfully we don't have any wise uses technique so we don't replace that so there are none of those to replace why it's so streamlined but then we have to empower too if you go ok what now let's just distribute the 2x plus we don't freaking do that you can't do that we have a derivative you strike the X but we have peas and X's is it separable no the linear' know what do I do hey is there an obvious substitution that you can make yes there's a composition right here once we call that composition be ok with obvious substitutions I solve for the dependent variable DP DX because with an obvious substitution you're trying to rap though P or will all of this as a different variable and then you're saying but I need to leave my independent variable get rid of my dependent variable so I need to solve for P I hope you remember this from from these these obvious substitutions you call them typically the composition you call that some variable you go right well let's solve for the dependent variable P that way I can take a derivative of it and do a double substitution idea the whole inside seemed to become V but then I need to be able to also substitute dpdx does that make sense I've got to get rid of that to all of the dependent variable must disappear just like here it did it's got to again alright well so DP DX would equal C function so that would be one DVD X minus 1 because the derivative of X with respect to X is 1 so this chain rule one DV DX this one that gives us something we can substitute so over on the right hand side kind of nice you said this whole thing is V so we have V squared we said all right well with obvious substitutions solve for the dependent variable that way when you take a derivative of it you can also replace DP DX and that's exactly what we have oh so wait a minute so you're saying we can we can use we can reduce the second order to a first order and then all of the techniques are open to us so we did that and go okay how do you do that one it looks like an obvious substitution so V is X plus P awesome solve for your dependent P equals X minus B do a derivative Y because if you're gonna replace that P you'd better replace the DP and so we've done that DP DX is DV DX that's a function of three tags okay minus one awesome and that all do our substitution so that's V squared cool this is DV DX minus one awesome what in the world is that well it's not linear notice that DV DX v squared nonlinear separable yeah let's add one and then have one over V squared plus one equals one hey that's a separable equation let's group RV's TV and our constants or DX and now we are ready to integrate on both sides it looks pretty nice integral of V squared plus one I hope you remember it and we love V squared plus one is tan inverse V squared plus one equals x plus C sub one that's our first arbitrary constant we're going to two of them in this case oh my gosh what in the world did we do now well yeah before we do substitutions it's awful nice to well I totally that was a brain-dead sorry guys that should just be V naught V squared plus one um tan inverse of V just on role I guess equals x plus C sub one just like ever be screwed this month what so any like 10 the integral of 1 over V squared this one is tan inverse of V naught V squared plus 1 equals x plus C sub 1 great ok know what well we got it substitute back in for V but I like to solve for V first if I can let's make V equal to tangent of the right hand side so if tan inverse of V equals x plus C sub 1 then V itself equals tangent of X plus C sub 1 all right let's keep on moving now V equals something what's what's B equal so we use the substitution to get get something we can work with a separable let's let's replace it so V is X plus P ok this is looking a little bit better or worse than your perspective but wait a minute P means something oh I like to solve for P before a replace it you noticing this solve for the variable that you're trying to reach substitute for before you substitute it's a way cleaner so let's let's do that so P is now tangent X plus C sub 1 minus X ok well know what's P oh yeah he was pretty nice he was just dy yes that's separable in drove itself and if we take an integral on both sides we get y equals if you take an internal correctly where it's supposed to go on both sides we get life on my gosh wrote it when the water is tangent integration table should be a saint ln should be Ln of absolute value of one secant oh yeah soap Ln absolute value secant X plus C sub 1 and x2 value minus x squared over 2 or 1/2 of X plus another arbitrary constant because get two different integrals that we're doing not the same as doing an integral on both sides and getting two differents two seas that you can combine this is different you're integrating an arbitrary constant from a previous integral that's a different idea so we have y greater melon absolute value secant X plus C sub 1 and then x squared over 2 plus C sub 2 let's just call our arbitrary constants something slightly different eggs and visas which are mostly going to C so y equals Ln absolute value secant grade X plus a minus x squared over 2 1 plus B so great example for you to see Nano makes sense that you understand yeah you have a reduced will second order but when you reduce it you might have to use other techniques here so you might have to dig deep and go bad that's an obvious obvious substitution well be solve for your dependent variable that way you take a derivative you replace your DP DX your d dependent variable or X great we're gonna solve for the thing you need to replace replace it solve for the thing you need to replace replace it and then integrate again and then we end up with something nasty but that's the right answer ok I think we have one more to do and then we'll be good to go so last example here we're dealing with these second order differential equations that we can reduce to first order differential equation solve that first order with techniques that are known replace it with the derivative we substitute for and then do an integral again getting two arbitrary constants now we run this last one but that's not nearly as involved as our previous example but I want to show you what to pick whether you should wear what option you should go with if possible so we have second derivative of Y with respect to X both x equals the first derivative Y squared is it a second order differential equation yes is it reducible yes why well because it's gonna see why but wait a minute it's also missing X that's true and so you get to pick which option you want to go down most of the time the missing Y is easier to work with because the substitution is nice nicer so when we look at this I go hey I'm missing axes and I'm missing y's you actually you do have options you can go with either case now have a cover missing X but I would I would suggest that you go with missing Y because it's easier especially for this case so let's try it let's just replace our first derivative of the variable that way when I take this derivative of that variable I can also replace my second derivative and let's try it so the second derivative the Y becomes DP DX the first derivative of Y becomes a P squared that's about as nice as it gets so keeping it simple is really nice and using the the missing Y option rather than missing next option typically keeps clean things a lot cleaner the other option works but this is going to be cleaner for us so let's continue with it hey it's separable let's pull our peas over let's go ahead and integrate so when we integrate we have an integral of P to the negative 2nd power DP equals integral DX and we get this add 1/2 exponent equals x plus C sub 1 we're gonna clean up just a bit so let's see negative 1 over P equals x plus C sub 1 you know I don't like that negative so let's solve for P as much as possible before we start replacing people with what it actually is so negative 1 over P let's multiply everything by negative 1 that would be negative X minus C sub 1 all right one of the P equals you know what I might do right now I might take this guy and call this C sub 2 so now we'll be able to date so C sub 2 minus X that's fine hey now we can reciprocate and get that P equals 1 over C sub 2 - next we've done all this stuff before we're just now wrapping it up in this new technique now that we solve for P we can replace p with what actually equals so P is the first derivative of Y with respect to X let's show that when we solve for that P it makes the rest of this problem really really nice because all we've got to do is integrate both sides with respect to X so when we do that when we integrate both sides respect to X we get y equals u so you would be C sub 2 minus X the derivative is negative 1 so this would be a negative Ln absolute value C sub 2 minus X let's see some three weird that one to our next arbitrary constant yeah that's about as good as I think we can make it the only thing we would we do after this is maybe switch some stuff around call this C sub 3 minus Ln absolute value C sub 2 times X and then because sometimes we don't want to work with subscripts we can call this these two different arbitrary constants we'd say a minus Ln absolute value b minus X as about as good as it gets man my goal is always to explain things to a level that you actually understand them the reasons behind them and are able to do them so I hoping that's happened here the idea is if you have a second order difference or the equation and you are missing a Y variable call the first derivative Pete called the second derivative DP DX so replacing the first trivet of the variable therefore the second derivative is the derivative of the variable or really nicely just don't forget the two main things when you do your first solving of your differential equation your hand with key solve for your P you need to replace that with what P equals and then you're gonna have to get a grid again you get two arbitrary constants I'm gonna see for the next video and we're gonna talk about how this all works if we're not missing Y but we're missing X here we were missing both of them so it didn't really matter but this way is going to be cleaner and that's typically the case if you're missing both variables choose the missing the y1 or Y gone I'll see you for the next video when we discuss how to do this the second order differential equation happily reducible by missing an X variable have a great day you
