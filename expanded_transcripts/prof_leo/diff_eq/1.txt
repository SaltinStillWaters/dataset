Transcript for: Introduction to Differential Equations (Differential Equations 2)
well here we are the first video on differential equations and it's just an introduction because right now you're you're sitting there trying to wonder if you can learn differential equations you're either in a class or you're doing on your own and that's fine but it's kind of the first question is what are we actually doing so I'm gonna take some time to explain what in the world difference of equations is all about what the goals are what you should be looking for what they're based on after that the next video I'm just gonna show you how to check to see whether an equation is actually a solution of a differential differential equation so what the differential equation tries to do number one we're trying to model some real-life situation a real life change that's the goal here so that means there's a lot of word problems yeah because we're trying to actually do stuff now the problem is is that there's a balance you see in real life and you know this because you've experienced something that you've tried to do mathematically like wow there's there's lots of different stuff going on and that's the same problem that we run into in differential equations is that the more variables you add the harder it is to do the math so there's definitely a balance between a mathematical model that perfectly represents your situation and the ability to actually do that mathematical model so sometimes we we omit even though it doesn't seem right we omit some of the situation so that we can actually do the math and the models work pretty good are they perfect not always no but that's why we're always refining our techniques we're always learning more math so that we can further represent this model we're to scratch them a service and that's what differential equation starts with is scratching the surface on how to represent real life change with math that's number one so we're trying to do number two is what a differential equation actually is so what these things do is they relate a derivative in an equation so that's a differential equation if you have an equation with derivatives in them you're dealing with differential equations if you've taken calc 1 on top calc 2 and calc 3 even you have dealt with differential equations they were very basic but anytime you do an integral you can assume that you're dealing with a differential equation that's one of the techniques to solve them as a matter of fact we do lots of integrals well its derivatives represent things that are changing and then that's that's what we're trying to deal with in our difference of equations so derivatives represent change and since the goal is represent real life change we're going to be dealing with derivatives anytime we're dealing with a changing thing so like velocity or acceleration or population change as a respect to time these things are always changing and we can represent them fairly well with a different difference of equations hope you're getting this so far we're not necessarily focused on numbers anymore solutions that's not our number one thing to start with because the solution to a differential equation is actually an equation itself imagine this you have an equation with a derivative of something well the derivative is a derivative of some function or looking for that function and then we can use that function to do other things but the primary goal is find the function for this derivative that you have in your equation that that's the idea that we're trying to do so in a differential equation just to recap this stuff we're dealing with real life change change means we have derivatives a derivative comes from some function find the function that's a solution to a differential equation but when we find those solutions they're usually this infinite family of equations so remember when you do an integral and you teach you probably yell at you every time you forgot the little I know I would yell at you for every time you're going o plus C like what's the big deal with a plus C that plus C represents a family in infinite family of equations that when you take a derivative of it it gives you that solution or it gives you the equation that you started with well that's the same thing we have going on here if you have an equation with derivatives in them and you find the solution so this this equation that you if you take a derivative of it it's gonna give you this thing that you have in your differential equation well if you put a plus C on that you have this infinite family of equations and so we basically deal with the same arbitrary constant idea that you didn't calc two and three and even calc one put a little bit the entire class you do an integral plus C you do you find the solution to a differential equation you're going to have an arbitrary constant in fact on the skipped down here in fact the order which is just the highest derivative that you have in your differential equation so a first derivative order one second derivatives in there you get order two third derivative gotta order three it as your order goes up the number of arbitrary constants also goes up so if you have a second order differential equation so a second derivative in there you're going to have two arbitrary constants if you have just a first derivative you're going to have one arbitrary constant so call it C if you have two of them it call it a and B that's that's what's gonna happen here as your order goes up as the highest derivative increases so if you have a first derivative or a second derivative third degree of derivative you're arbitrary constants are going to increase you think of it think about why per second okay just just think through this if you need to this is the simplest case if you need to undo a first derivative with an integral you're gonna get a plus C let's say you had a second derivative okay undo that second derivative by an integral that makes the first derivative but you have a plus C now do it again well that plus C is gonna get a variable tacked on it with your next integral and then another plus C you're going to get two arbitrary constants that's what happens here so that's what I mean by or and then that's what I mean here by as the ordered increases arbitrary constants go up to so we talked a little bit about how solutions are an infinite family of equations that's a plus C idea if you're given an initial condition so like hey Y of Y of 0 equals 5 then we can start using that in our equation the solution this family of equations and I will give you a specific constant that's the way we narrow down our solutions from this general solution which is a family with like plus seeds or stuff into a very specific or particular solution it just requires an initial condition the so let's let's recap a little bit our goals modern way let's change change means derivative the derivatives in the equation differential equation that's it that's the whole idea here well we're not necessarily focused on finding numbers as solutions because what we know about derivatives is their front functions were trying to find the equation so the equations become our solutions functions become our solutions every time you find one it's gonna have a plus C in it it's going to be a family of curves that work in this differential equation as the order goes up number of so like second derivative third derivative fourth derivative the number of constants also goes up that should make sense we talk about the integral thing you get a plus C do it again you get a C and let's call it X and then another different plus C more arbitrary constants if you have an initial condition then you can narrow down your general solution to get a particular solution it says how all these curves are solutions but if they have to go through this one point there's only one quickly does that and that's how we narrow down the general solution into the particular so the family into one particular solution so we're looking for last thing I want to talk to you about right now is ordinary differential equations versus partial order differential equations ordinary doesn't mean commonplace what it means is that all of the difference of equations in ordinary differential equations are based on the fact that we will have one independent variable usually X it's not the case where we have two independent variables like the calc three partial derivative sort of thing where you count them as two independent variables that would be partial order differential equation if that's less later alright so right now we're focused on having equations in these equations that have derivatives differential equations the primary functions are all based on one independent variable usually X sometimes it's T for time that's what we're doing so all this stuff hopefully makes sense is where we're going now I know I haven't explained everything about it well we're going to start very simply in the next video we're going to talk about is how to check just check whether an equation is a solution to a differential equation or it's not so this hopefully makes sense where we're becoming from real-life situations derivatives are changing things so we're gonna have them in that equation and then we have a family because the integral idea of plus C as your order goes up more plus C's if you will and we can restrict that family to one particular solution if you have an initial condition alright check out the next video because right now we're going to start plugging in equations to see if they're actually solutions see you next time you
