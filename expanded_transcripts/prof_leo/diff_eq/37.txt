Transcript for: Stability of Critical Points (Differential Equations 37)
hi welcome to another video in this video we're going to explore stability of critical points a little bit more in depth we'll deal with some part of problems we'll talk about how in the world you can have a spout and a funnel in the same problem so we're going to take a look at four examples first going all the way through we'll start with critical points we'll talk about whether they're stable or unstable how that should look on a graph and then we'll go ahead and solve the differential equation behind it and try to see that they make the same exact graph after that we'll deal with three examples where we just take a look at the the first derivative test or kind of sign analysis test for this differential equation as far as the critical points concern and just go straight through the graph just to get a real clear picture what these things are doing so let's start with the first example we have a differential equation DX DT where X is our dependent variable t is our independent variable x squared minus 4x and what we learned in the last video was that when we're talking about a difference of equation that right there is a first-order differential equation or a first derivative which means that that's a first derivative so if we ever want to find critical points just like calculus one all we've got to do is take this function which is the first derivative of some higher function and do the first derivative test on that function itself so if we're looking for critical points all we've got to do is say hey our function here is x squared minus 4x and if we set that equal to zero we're gonna find critical points very easily if that's this same function and this function is a first derivative then setting a first derivative equal to zero gives us critical points so let's take this and say hey if we factor out an X makes a lot easier by the zero product property to find our critical points we get zero and we get positive 4 so our critical points are zero and positive 4 now there's no way for us to say right off the bat that then those are stable or unstable without doing some sort of a sign analysis test or just a first derivative test the way it showed you last video to do that is do very something very similar to what we had in like a calculus one or even calculus two level class where we take our critical points we put them in order on some sort of a number line and we basically say hey if that's the first derivative where this is positive our function will be increasing where this is negative our function will be decreasing and where this is 0 our function will be constant or horizontal so we know that from from our first of our calculus 1 days that this function is only going to be 0 at 0 or 4 which means that our function itself the higher fo to the parent function here is going to have a peak or a kind of anti peak or a valley at 0 and 4 that's where our slope will be 0 now anywhere else our function is going to be climbing or Thorman if this function is continuous so what we're going to do is say since this is based on our function f of X let's plug in something something in this range like negative 1 1 and 5 and let's see what happens and this is going to tell us whether our critical points of 0 and 4 are stable no its stable means stable means that on both sides of that critical point our function is tending to go towards it unstable means away from it semi-stable is from one side right we're going towards it for another side where we're leaving it and that's what say my stable is we're gonna see that in the next few examples so let's plug in a number like I don't know negative 1 now remember that this is a slope all we're caring about is whether it's positive or negative we don't care about the actual value we care whether our function is increasing or decreasing on this interval since this represents a slope this is a first derivative this represents a slope it'll tell us if the slope is positive whether it functions increasing or negative whether functions decreasing so when it's like a negative 1 okay I'll write negative 1 enter function negative 1 squared is 1 4 times negative 1 is negative 4 1 plus 4 is 5 now I don't care about the 5 but I care about the fact that it's positive what that means is that our slope is pause so remember our parent function this would be the slope for sole function of our parent function our slope would be positive for this interval our function therefore so if I were to solve this I'm going to get the parent function a higher function our attention function our function here would be increasing so since our slope is positive our function is increasing and if you want to show a little bit more work you say hey for X values less than zero this means that our function is positive and you can show that does it really matter i I'm not sure it kind of depends on on if you're a particular class which your instructor wants for me personally I'd say this is good enough this say it says what you're plugging in this says that for this interval our function our soap is positive inner function is increasing now how about the one if we plug in something like 1 if I plug in 1 to my derivative here to my first derivative to the function that represents the first derivative or our slope well 1 minus 4 is negative that means that for this interval between 0 and 4 since 0 of 4 on the only two places where our slope can change sign every value in here is going to have the same output it's either going to be positive or negative so I don't have to go plug in a lot of different numbers we've already found where we have our zeros our critical points is zero and for every number between years 7 from our calculus 1 days it's going to have the same sign and so when I plug in 1 and say hey that's negative that means if my slope for my potential function is negative in this interval then all of that family of functions them about to find are decreasing now I said something there that you need to kind of remember a little bit since this is a first derivative since this is a differential equation it's it's a first derivative for a whole family of curves and similar to what we're doing this is pretty profound what we're saying is that for all of those functions for which visit the slope all of them are going to be increasing from negative infinity to zero all of them are going to be decreasing from zero to four and then if you plug in five and you okay five squared minus that's 25 minus 20 that's another positive it's positive five all of them are going to be increasing from 4 to infinity and that's fantastic we don't know exactly what our function is because it's going to this is defense solving this differential equation is going to give us a general solution a family of curves but depending on what our initial condition is we be able to find this particular solution what this is saying is that all of our general solutions or our general solution all of our curves here are going to be increasing on the interval of negative theta 0 decrease on an interval of 0 to 4 and increasing from our interval from 4 to infinity that that's pretty cool that means that this goes increasing forever now so if that represents the thing in their general solution here we can say that for every single particular solution in that general solution so solving our difference equation all of them are going to have a stable critical point at x equals 0 notice how our function no matter what it's going to be as a positive slope and a negative so they're going to increase and decrease around that x equals 0 that's called a stable critical point but round 4 we did something different we say that around 4 if we're below that our function is decreasing or slope is negative or if function is increasing above that or so is positive and we're tending to go away from that that's called unstable now how is it gonna look let me come over here I want to show you and then we're gonna go ahead and solve this differential equation we're gonna see that it gives us the same exact graph so if I have these two critical points x equals 0 and x equals 4 I want to make sure I put them in order here's what's going to happen with our stable critical points our general solution is going to no matter where we start our general solutions going to tend towards it for unstable critical points no matter where we start our general solution is going to go away from it and so when we have two or more critical points these things sort of interplay off one another so if I start below x equals 0 what this says is that if I start let null is let's put all this together ok this is a first derivative this says that this is the slope for every potential function that has this as a slope that means that I'm going to have some arbitrary constants or not and the arbitrary constant is going to give us sort of this initial value dependent function if my initial value starts below x equals 0 I'm going to be increasing if I start bellowing to equal zero this is going to give us a picture of our general solution based on this so if I start below X equals 0 I'm going to be increasing my function is going to be increasing it's going to go like a funnel it's going to funnel into this from below so I'm going to funnel into x equals zero it says I have to increase where am I gonna increase in telling you 2x equals zero now what about what about above that if I start above x equals zero or between 0 & 4 I'm going to be decreasing and that says Fulda this says I'm gonna go away from x equals 4 I'm gonna go towards X x equals zero so no matter where I start between here I'm going to be moving away from x equals 4 but towards x equals zero so this says if this is our slope it says you're decreasing on this interval no matter what your initial value is your function will be decreasing kind of depends on where I start but where I start I'm sorry no matter where I start I'm going to be decreasing some help now above 4 I will be having a positive so for every single particular solution depending on what our initial value is I'm going to be increasing so where I start doesn't really matter as far as what I'm doing it'll give us a particular type of curve but it says matter where you start up here you're going to have a positive slope you're going to be increasing and we can get a very clear picture of our general solution with just this work so I said earlier in the last three examples I'm just gonna be doing this I'm just going to show you this these curves I'm gonna practice doing some difference of equations so you see some more advanced techniques but in general this this is really all all that we kind of need to get a clear picture of it so what we're doing taking a first derivative doing the first derivative test allowing that to give us a general solution or picture of our general solution so let's do it it says below see below zero I'm stable so that means I should get a funnel here so if I start below here we should get a funnel notice how I have several curves why do you have several curves well this is a picture of our general solutions so without a particular initial value we can't get a particular solution all we can say is that all of these curves are going to be increasing depending on the value less than zero our initial value starts less than zero you are going to be increasing now what if our initial value starts between zero and four you're going to be decreasing so we're gonna have several types of curves here we're gonna get some that look that look like this and as we get closer to our 4 we're gonna get curves this that look like going away and coming to that zero this is called a funnel when we when we get towards a value from both sides that critical point this is funneling to that x equals zero we're leaving this for that spout or leaving this or spouting away from the floor funneling into the zero so when I said that we have a general solution here this could be man you could be any of these curves down here any of these curves up here or any of the ones we're about to get up here depending on what your initial value is so if our initial value starts less than zero we're going to climb to it if our initial value starts between zero and four we're gonna go away from the four and towards the zero far initial value start to above four we're going to be leaving that four and it's a fairly clear picture on that this is not a computer program unfortunately it not the computer um that's probably fortunate but it'll give you a depend on how well I can draw these these things a clearer picture of what our general solution is again there's not just one curve here because what our particular solution depends on is a starting point an initial value if our initial value is somewhere down here we're gonna climb to zero so we're between here we're gonna fall to zero so we're above here we're gonna go away from that for this is what stability and instability disability looks like for critical points we go to it and what's called a funnel or away from it in what's called a spell I hope that makes sense to you now what we're gonna do is we're going to go through and we're gonna solve this differential equation and it looks like we're gonna have some partial fractions here so acceptable and difference equation partial fractions will go through fairly quickly because I've done it so many times with you but what I really want to get at is two main ideas number one main idea is this function is a slope function for some sort of potential function or some sort of parent function or something haven't found yet sometimes we haven't found so when I do a first root of test I don't take another two that would be a second derivative test so I'm not really concerned about concavity I will tell you this a little bit better but I'm not concerned about that I'm concerned that this is a first derivative it will directly give me critical points set equal to zero that's important being able to do a first derivative test is is pretty pretty big second thing when I take this and I make a graph from it what I'm taking is a picture of our derivatives our first derivatives and letting that tell me what our general solution is doing whether we're increasing or decreasing on an interval that's going to give us a fairly clear picture of a general solution it means you're going to get lots of curves because we're saying that we don't have a particular solution or sorry a particular initial value so we can't get a particular solution you have to have an initial starting spot to say whether you're down here and climbing between here and falling up here in climate you have to know that otherwise we get a picture of a general solution that's a lots of curves as a family of curves so just be aware of what we're doing when we're doing this okay first frame is slow and when we when we start getting a graph of those family of curves or given general solution we're gonna see that in our solving or difference equations so let's do it so we know that this is factorable we've already done that and it to be separate our variables here and we take an integral of both sides right hand side very easy left hand side we're gonna have partial fractions so 1 over X X minus 4 remember that linear factors factors give up as fractions linear gives us a constant numerator we're getting a a common denominator here so we're gonna multiply X minus 4 and X and since we have an equation here with its the same denominators that's why you find a common denominator our numerators would also have to be equal and so when we find a common denominator and it alters our numerators we just have to set our numerators equal then we do some fancy stuff like hey what if I what if X were zero if X were zero that this would be zero this would be negative four and one would have to equal a times negative four giving us a equals negative one-fourth or if X is four and this would be zero but this would be B times four so one would have to equal B times four and B would give us one-fourth of them and now we can rewrite this as something that's a little easier to take an integral of we'd say hey this whole fraction is a over X B over X minus four if it is one negative one-fourth that's negative 1 over 4x plus 1 over 4 times X minus 4 DX and you see me do this a few different ways I've always factored out this this denominator here this is 1/4 sometimes I'll factor the negative sometimes I won't and if you're wondering why I do that I've explained a couple times but I like my single term denominator to be negative that way when I make my Ln I combine these two natural logarithms into one I have a single term on the denominator that's that's kind of nice next thing what I'll do is once I factor that out this 1/4 you've seen me go ahead and integrate right now you've also seen me multiply by 4 that's really up to you I'm gonna multiply by 4 right now because I I just want to get rid of that do you have to know it doesn't really matter because that arbitrary constant whether you multiply by 4 now and call whatever you get on immigration C or integrate now and multiply C times 4 you still get an arbitrary constant it doesn't really matter but it's a little cleaner to multiply by 4 right now clear this out so I'm gonna multiply by 4 on both sides I'm also going to integrate so when we get the integral negative 1 over plus one over X minus four equals four times an integral of DT so just multiplying by four on the left hand side yeah we're gonna get a negative Ln absolute value of x we'll get another Ln absolute value of X minus four on the right hand side at least simply get four T plus C sub one you see that many times we're going to call that C sub one because we're about to combine these natural logarithms using X 1 on both sides and that right there is gonna change we're gonna get plus or minus e to the C sub 1 or wrap all that up that's as C if you didn't multiply it by 4 and I've done it both ways if you didn't multiply it by 4 right here you have a 1/4 and you've multiplied by forward now giving us a 40 plus 4 C sub 1 for C sub 1 doesn't matter it's still arbitrary constant so let's combine our logarithms exponent on both sides when we do that we're gonna wrap up a plus and minus e to the C sub 1 times e to the 14 and this whole thing is going to become our C or arbitrary constant so X minus 4 over x equals C e to the 14 now let's poss remember this thing that what we're doing you've heard me mention that this is a first derivative tells us slope of a general solution okay that tells us what our general solution is doing as far as increasing or decreasing and we learn that it depends on the initial value that's what we get a whole bunch of potential curves potential functions here they're either increasing decreasing or increasing depending on what our initial condition is well we better find out in an in tradition or at least have way to show that in our work so with that arbitrary constant let's make it represent our initial conditions what's our initial condition well when we know our initial condition would be some value at time zero so whatever x value is at time zero let's call it X sub zero plug that in and it will allow you to solve for your arbitrary concert right now that arbitrary constant will be this value that depends on an initial condition it will tell us where we start and what our curve looks like depending on that and so when we do this we okay let's let's allow X of 0 to be X of 0 so the x value at time 0 right there that squeezie row it's going to be X of 0 let's plug that in so X is 0 minus 4 over X of 0 equals C times e to the 4 times 0 so when T is 0 our x value is X of 0 notice that what this is going to allow us to do is create this general solution where all we need to know is what our value starts out think of it as population what our population starts at and then we can plug it in and it'll tell us where we are what our particular solution is so our C value since this is 1 equals x at 0 minus 4 over X is 0 now this is super nasty I don't really want to go plugging this in because can you see it I got a fraction of the deal with all that junk so here's what I'm to do what I'm going to do is I'm gonna keep this as a C as long as I can and at the very end well whenever I can't keep it as a C reasonably anymore I'm gonna now put this in so I'm thinking of this in my head thinking C is this I'm just gonna not plug it in right now because otherwise I have a lot of complex fractions I have a lot of common denominators I have to find I might have to do that later but for now just for ease of working with it I'm gonna keep this as a seat and I want to solve for X as much as I can so what that means for us is I'm going to multiply both sides by X going to get X's on one side are constant on the other I'm a factor in X and then divide so I'm going to multiply the X right now I'm going to group my X's on one side nan X terms on the other we're going to back through an X we're gonna divide remember that this X is a function of T it is a function at this point we can't go any further without using this but do you see what happened now maybe you want to try it if you want to you can plug this in right here and go through it but your X sub zero's and your X's I see a lot of students get those confused and they if you drop that initial value this X of zero starts looking a lot like an X and then you go Oh chunky fine s that up my problems pretty much smoke so this is my preference my preference is trying to keep it as a see of course everything I talked about different equations stays where it is don't don't relearn anything here what I'm showing is as soon as it's possible you do solve for your arbitrary constant we've done that we're just not plugging it in yet if we're being smart about saying this is what it is let's solve for X boom and then we can plug in our initial values so once we've done that we go locate this right here this is X sub zero months for X sub zero no matter that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't look so great and not only that it's not what's in the back of my book or wherever you got this problem or whatever you're working on you're right but you can see what it does it says instead of working on with a complex fraction or some sort of fraction all the way through this problem and having to distribute within factor with it it allows you to say well now that I have a simple complex fraction the very end I can do things like hey how do you how do you simplify complex fractions well you've multiplied by the LCD or least common denominator those comes another way which is just X of 0 and if you remember that you're going to distribute that then our function becomes for X of 0 distribute x0 - these are going to cancel when I distribute now I do I absolutely have to put a parenthesis around this because it is multiplied by e to the 14 but that's it that's a lot nicer than working with this fraction all the way through so one time then we'll talk about that is one time all the way through you start with different equation first order difference equation and you are starting with the slope of some sort of higher functions of parent function potential function if your start with the slope do a first derivative test it tells you what your function is doing it tells you that for certain intervals you are positive slope negative so positive so increasing decreasing and increasing that will actually give you a picture of what your general solution do lots of different curves here because we're talking in general it requires these things you know have a general solution right arbitrary constant gives you general solution this is giving you a general solution you need it particular in initial value to get a particular solution that's why we have this arbitrary constant salt for an initial condition or initial value problem when we use that this says depending on what your initial population is your initial starting amount is it's going to give you one of these curves not all of them one of them is gentleness everything that could possibly happen this is every slope you could possibly have this is every general every particular solution you could possibly have it's called a general solution finding one of them requires a single value so if our values let's let's take a look just to make sure we're really clear if our value is less than zero that would be negative if it's like negative one or something this would be a negative let's see this would be negative one this would be a negative oval wait this is positive isn't it so something positive this right here is something less than zero maybe pause this would be something be the more less so they define but adding that you're going to get a negative over negative that's a positive you were going to get something that is I'm sorry so the slope would be positive the function itself will be negative but getting closer and closer and closer to zero if we start between 0 and 4 so something like like 1 then be positive that would be positive that would be negative depend on what that value is something between zero and four are slow believe negative however so we're going to be constantly are consistently dropping toward zero as we continue with it to be a decreasing function and lastly we start above four we're getting something that's increasing so this this right here is modeled by this graph right here that we've drawn it depends on what your initial condition is you only get a particular solution I hope that makes sense that we're gonna do a few more I'm not going to go as in-depth on my explanation as I've just done with you we're gonna basically get this good picture practice doing our differential equations and we move on that so hang on seen an example in just a second alright here we go let's take a look at this first order differential equation which means we're dealing with a slope this is a slope of some sort a slope a function of some sort of a potential function that we've got now what we're gonna do we're gonna say this is our function then this represents the first derivative and therefore we can do a first derivative test to find out the critical points let's try it so our function looks like we might be able to factor it there's a good clue there for us it's a difference of squares if you do it right and set it equal to zero is exactly how we find critical points or critical points are two and negative two by the zero product property let's do a first derivative test now we always want to make sure these are in order because it doesn't represent a number line for us but we're going to plug in values that say hey if this is a slope then everything in this interval is going to have every potential function this interval so you have the same slope positive or negative same thing here safely here these are the only places x equals negative 2 and x equals 2 those critical points where slope can change signs that's it and so what we're gonna work on is hey let's plug in something like negative 3 see what the slope is doing if we plug in negative 3 to our function here see that's 9 minus 4 that's positive don't really care that it's what the actual value is but what I do care about is that this is positive let's increasing L at zero zero minus four is negative and how about three three minus three squared minus four is positive so this tells us that our function itself by playing in just a single value here they're all gonna have the same value of sign of slope so positive negative positive says we're going to be increasing decreasing increasing no matter where we start if our initial value is in this this interval our parent potential higher whatever function is going to be increasing it's going to be decreasing it is this interval is going to be increasing here right now you should tell me which of these are stable and which of these are unstable we should know that this is stable this is unstable you should have a picture in your head of what is going on right now you should understand that right here this is going to be a funnel things are going towards this functions going towards negative two this is spell things are going away from positive two so when we take a look at it this is funneling towards and spouting away we have this final idea and spy idea again this is what our function should look like depend on where we start we're going to get one of these curves something increasing to negative two or decreasing to negative two something increasing away from two away from two so we have this funnel and spout ID let's solve a differential equation let's see if we can get a general solution that is modeled by this picture of our general solution this hey let's solve it kind of fun to solve anyway so we already know that this is factorable let's go ahead and let's keep this factor especially when I know that I'm getting some some functions they're gonna be solved by partial fractions I leave it factored so a little bit easier that way let's group these variables so separate our variables here if we integrate both sides we immediately see we're going to have some project partial fractions so let's take a look at that right over here and say hey you know what if I take a look at my partial fractions and let the number of factors equal the number of fractions that I get I understand that linear denominators give us constant numerators say that if I find a common denominator here we're going to say that one our numerators would have to be equal would have to equal a times X plus 2 plus B times X minus 2 plug in 2 and negative 2 it's gonna allow you to solve for a and B very nicely so x equals 2 that would be 0 that would be 4 it would have to be 1/4 likewise if X is negative 2 that would be 0 that would be no you to B would be negative 1/4 I know I've done that very quickly but that's why I gave you a whole video on how to deal with partial fractions because this should be at this point very very understandable the only thing I'm really trying to teach you is that that's a first riveted let the slope tell you what your general solution is doing start increasing and decreasing learn with stable and unstable mean be able to get a picture of your general solution without even have them doing work that's pretty cool so this will give you a population model really for where where I start matters by below or between or above it's going to show you what your particular solution is without even doing work hard work so now that we're able to say that our a is 1/4 or B is negative 1/4 we can alter our integral so we've got this integral of negative 1 over 4 let's see a was with the X minus 2 so a is 1/4 that would be a positive and then X minus 2 minus 1 over 4x plus 2 now I don't really care about the factor out that negative because I'm gonna have two terms no matter what I'm just gonna factor out the 1/4 you see me do this unless example will multiply by 4 and then we'll integrate so we factor the 1/4 and we multiply both sides makes it just a little bit cleaner and we integrate we're gonna have a natural logarithm x - 2 - on that natural logarithm absolute value X plus 2 equals 4t plus C sub 1 we're gonna do the same exact thing as last time we're going to group this as a single natural logarithm we know that subtraction gives us a quotient where everything's subtracted or negative goes in the denominator everything positive or plus goes in the numerator and we get this 4t + C sub 1 same exact thing I'm going to try to do all of it at once right now we're gonna take an exponent on both sides we'll wrap up a plus or minus e to the C sub 1 as a arbitrary constant so absolute value E and C sub 1 are all going to be C but we'll still have an e to the 14 on the left hand side we simply get X minus 2 and X plus 2 so we're taking both of these as an exponent on that natural number we're saying that this would separate into two different factors e to the C sub 1 and E to the 14 but either she said one is constant and absolute value can wrap that up as a plus or minus so plus M is either C sub one is a constant now what do I do now do I want to solve for X now or do I want to find my arbitrary constant now arbitrary constant soon as you can it's not great here as a horrible but here is really nice so if I plug in X of zero gives me some initial conditions some initial value problem well then when T is zero our x value is just our initial condition that's gonna let us solve for C but I'm not gonna plug it in here yet what I'm gonna do is I'm going to save this to the end and see what I can do is for our solving for x before I have to plug that in so now let's see that would be X sub zero minus 2 over X is here plus two equals C times e to the 4 times zero this whole thing is 1 and this it gives us our seat so RC but I'm gonna hang on to in my head C is X of 0 minus 2 over X of 0 plus 2 now I actually haven't done it this way on my notes what see if it works let's see if I can just solve for X here look at this and then later plug that in because if I tried it the first time doing it with this and that's crazy there's a lot of little nuanced math in there with common denominators that can really get you kind of all jacked up and so we're going to solve this for X as much as it's possible with the arbitrary constant that's not so arbitrary we're just going to treat it that way until the very end so let's try this so from here I would have to let's see I'd have to multiply both sides by X plus 2 I have to distribute we're gonna group our X terms on one side non X's on the other factor and divide so it's gonna look kind of nasty at first even though we don't have that with this thing it's incredibly nasty so let's first multiply both sides by X plus 2 that's gotta be in parentheses which means that I have to distribute that I'm going to group my X terms on one side mine on X terms on the other we're going to factor you can factor here too if you really want to the cloud think it's very necessary and we're going to divide it so our function of X in terms of T well of our independent variable T gives us a bat we go okay all right so so now well now what you do right here's where I would plug this in and do the same technique I just showed you so you're going to get a complex fraction right now and we're just going to simply multiply both the numerator and denominator by whatever LCD is of that complex fraction so from right here you alright let's let's make sure I've done everything right I've multiplied by X plus 2 got it I've distributed this looks pretty good I've got my X terms by subtracting my non-answers by adding on different sides I factored I mess a sign up looks the same here okay I've divided and now we're ready to go ahead and plug in that arbitrary constant that we've solved for and this right here contains our initial value so depending our initial value it's going to give us a different function that's why there's so many curves over here to pay our initial value it's going to give us a different function so two plus let's to be more room so that's C that is this thing now we're going to take that and say instead of the C since I've worked this all the way down to Salford X this is X at 0 minus 2 over X and 0 plus 2 and like well it's down here but now instead of having to have worked with bad distributed with that I'm just going to have to multiply both the numerator and another by X sub 0 plus 2 yes it will distribute it's still going to be a little bit nasty but it's a little bit nicer to work with and and to have it there the whole way through that so X sub 0 plus 2 over X sub 0 plus 2 when we distribute what's going to happen I need to distribute this whole expression to the 2 to the 1 it's going to cancel here so when I distribute this times this are X sub T X of T is going to give us 2 X sub 0 plus 4 because we're distributing this is going to get multiplied by the 2 that means that you're distributing to onto X to the sub 0 and 2 times 2 when we distribute to this whole entire term here are factors X sub 0 plus 2 and X sub 0 plus 2 they're going to cancel so we do get this but then we get a plus 2 X sub 0 minus 2 e to the 14 over what what happens here we would distribute x sub 0 plus 2 times 1 that's going to give us an X sub 0 plus 2 1 times X sub 0 is X 0 1 times 2 is 2 minus X sub 0 plus 2 e to the 14 that is about as good as we can give if you want to leave this factor as 2 times X sub 0 plus 2 it would look like this that's fine too it doesn't really matter it might be a little nicer since you can see it here but honestly it's it's it's really up to you so what this is this is your general solution notice how this solution depends on where you start so if I start with a value of less than negative 2 I'm going to get an increasing graph when I start with a value between negative 2 & 2 I'm going to get a decreasing graph if I start with the value above 2 I'm gonna get an increase in graph what if I start with a value at 2 at negative 2 those are called equilibrium solutions nothing would change so anyway I hope this is making sense I hope you've really started to see how this picture gives us this and we have to do a whole lot of work to find the general solution which our first derivative test model squared obviously for sin yell so hang on for a couple more examples we'll go quickly through them like we've been doing and then we'll start just doing the pictures okay let's go on a few others now I've shown you a couple times so that we can have funnels and spells in the same problem but what I haven't shown you is when we what a semi-stable critical point looks like and what the graph would look like so we're gonna do that with this we'll talk about I completely unstable critical point in the next example and then we'll go ahead and do with a combination of some of them so let's take a look at the derivative of X with respect to time is X minus T by X minus 2 squared so a first order differential equation represents our slope let's find the critical points now when our function this set equal to zero we really just get one critical point x equals two is the only critical point we have so when we have these repeated factors well zero product property says just take your your factor itself set equal to zero it has a multiplicity what multiplicity means is the degree of the factor that's giving you that 0 so that multiplicities even if you remember what multiplicity actually does it means that on both sides of that critical point you're going to get this symmetry so they will have the same value either both increasing both decreasing which means if we take this critical point and put it on our number line matter what I plug in it's going to have the same sign it's going to actually have the same value dependent no matter really as far as our science concerned about what we're plugging in so this is our first derivative represents of slope if I plug in something like 3 or something like 1 I'm gonna square both of them I'm going to get a positive our slope here is positive saying that our general solution is going to contain functions that are all increasing so whether I start below 2 or above 2 I'm increasing notice what's happening if I start below to my function is going to increase until always but increase until I get to 2 because they're above 2 it's gonna increase paths that this is called semi-stable in one interval and increasing to my critical point but in another interval I'm increasing away from it so we're not funneling to we're not spouting away this is semi-stable it's sort of like a funnel on one side and a spout on the other now what that's gonna look like for us is if I have one critical point if I start with an initial value of low - this says that every single one of my particular solutions or my general solution is going to be increasing so we're going to get this increasing all of these are gonna be an increasing functions if I start below - but start above - him going to be increasing so I'm gonna get increasing functions if I start a bug - notice how from below it looks like a funnel from above it looks like a spell that's what semi-stable would look like I'm going to be increasing to point or exploding if I if I have this initial value above that now what would that look like the population what that means here is that we would either get a leveling off this limiting population or I would get this explosion this doomsday scenario depinna where I start so that x equals to that equilibrium solution is real important start below that I'm gonna reach it above that I'm gonna explode in population now let's see what our solving of our differential equation actually looks like we don't have any partial fractions that's nice place you have something fairly simple if I treat this like the separable differential equation it is and get my 1 over X minus 2 squared DX on one side and our DT on the other and we get agree you can look at this as a simple u sub if you need to and say hey you would be X minus 2 but the derivative of X minus 2 is just 1 so you can just cover it up and say the derivative is not going to give us any sort of a constant that we need to divide by then we would say let's see you the new YouTube I add one that the the negative one over negative one and put my you back in there that X minus 2 so this would all become negative 1 over X minus 2 you to the negative 1 over sorry yeah over negative 1 so that'd be a negative sign and then we get X minus 2 to the negative 1 power or 1 over X minus 2 on the right hand side we just get T plus C now it's great juxtaposition of what we're about to do you see in the previous few examples like for a lot when we had partial fractions and lots of L lands we combine those we took the exponential on both sides and then we solved for that arbitrary constant here we don't have to do that you should be solving for your arbitrary constant now there's no e there's no C sub 1 it's fine do it right now so when I say that our initial value happens at time 0 and would give us an initial value of x of 0 our X would be X of 0 when R T is 0 and that was a salt or arbitrary constant right now since our arbitrary constant is based on our initial condition where we take 1 negative 1 over an initial value minus 2 we're going to hang on to that for a second we're going to solve this for X remember for putting this in our heads and saying this is what C is but I would solve for X first so how in the world would I solve for X now I might change signs might do that you don't have to I would do that if I change signs so starting from here multiply both sides by negative 1 then 1 over X minus 2 would give us negative t minus C now something you can't do because this C is already defined don't go changing that sign right now that's gonna mess everything up so this see is this thing right here you're going to start changing this and saying oh let's just make that plus e you would have to define this as C sub one you'd have to have some sort of a C equals C sub one C equals negative C sub one and then you go ahead and do that but you have to backwards map it so my encouragement to you is don't don't do that don't change that sign because it gets very confusing and sometimes we'll mess some signs up if we do that so I'm gonna just leave this as minus C understanding I already solved for that this this is the thing right now okay if you'd have had that in there wouldn't you be changing that sign yeah of course you would so don't be taking this and wrapping that up as a general arbitrary constant right now because you already saw work you're just holding on to it until the very end I hope you get that now because I have 1 over X minus 2 equals negative t minus C I can make this basically reciprocate both sides I can say that X minus 2 therefore we equal 1 over negative t minus C if we add 2 we could but add 2 we get 2 plus 1 over negative t minus C here's a good time to do one of two things either you can factor out a negative and change the sign no - I'm not going to do that or you can plug in C right now I am gonna do that why I'm not factoring the negative is because that's negative and waiting to do is subtract that negative it's gonna change to plus anyhow and that's really what I want so I'm gonna do it that way so here's our general solution in terms of T we have to plus 1 over negative t minus C but I know what C is C is that negative 1 over X sub 0 minus 2 so let's let's simplify this a bit what in the world do we do now that's a complex fraction well we know that we're going to multiply by the LCD or the only number that's that's here what we don't do we don't multiply this here and then accidentally distributed to here that's that's not something we need to do that - that - is fine just leave it now in a moment once we take care of this we are gonna find a common denominator we're gonna make one fraction out of it but you don't distribute this X is 0-2 you know distribute it to it so when I multiplied by X of 0 minus 2 over X - 0 - 2 it's just to this fraction so this thing it's multiplied times 1 this thing yes it gets distributed here so X of T is - don't distribute here plus X of 0 - 2 / when we distribute this we're going to get negative T X of 0 - 2 + 1 that's going to cancel that denominator I might reverse these just a bit now you can leave it just like that my preferences - if you have to if it doesn't look quite right to you you have to find a common denominator for this - so you'd be multiplying times this denominator it's self and then you can combine this this fraction I'm not going to do that reason why I'm not going to do that is this this shows really clearly where that numbers come from this says hey you're starting with a shift up remember that constantly shift up of two and then depending on what your initial value is you're going to get a increasing curve with two different concavities yeah probably so we have this increase we have this increase but only until we get to that - and I like that - there because it shows us that that vertical shift so anyhow I hope that that's making sense that mod this is our general solution it is based on initial value and so is this so we'll deal with one more all the way through we'll change that exponent and see what happens and then we'll talk to us about the pictures all right we're different all the way through now we've changed just one loud to small things we're gonna give a completely different look at solving of a differential equation and a completely different look of what our general solution is so that's a first derivative that's a difference of equation first short of your equation represents the slope of some sort of potential functions that means that if that's a slope function we can do a first derivative test to solve for critical points and again we just get one critical point our multiplicity is odd what's that mean that means that on both sides of this critical point we're gonna get opposites so odd multiplicity says that you are reflected about the origin and even means you're freaked about the like a y-axis sort of idea and so here we're gonna go all right if our critical point is one we do this on a first derivative test or a sign analysis or whatever you want to call it I plug in zero I'm gonna get a negative well plug in - I'm gonna get a positive saying our function is doing two different things to the left or on the interval from negative a to one all of our particular solutions or a general solution there going to be decreasing or so that will all be negative they're greater than one we're all going to be increasing or are so good positive which says that every particular solution if we start above one it's going to be with an issue value is going to be increasing that right there is a completely unstable critical point what that means is that for below x equals one we're going to be decreasing and above one we're going to get functions that are increasing now they might look different than this but in general that's exactly what we're gonna get so that right there says that we're going to get a spout now let's go ahead and solve this differential equation see if we can see that as far as our general solutions is here again we have the separable differential equation where we can group our X's on one side DX are constants DT and take an integral of both sides we have this u sub again well we can imagine a derivative of x minus 1 is just 1 so it's kind of a trivial U sub I like to cover that up and say okay if that's a if that's a uu to the negative third power I would add one that's U to the negative 2 over negative 2 so I'm going to get this negative 2 over U or X minus 1 to the negative 2 or squared equals T oh sorry let's see I think I have a too long spot so let me just do like you said with integral of u the negative third power D you would give us us you to the negative 2 over negative 2 yeah I see I'd mess my denominator up that would give us this X minus 1 to the negative 2 over negative 2 or negative 1 over 2x minus 1 squared if that right there's what we get from our left integral so negative 1/2 X minus 1 squared equals T plus C now I'm going to do a C sub 1 for just one reason I don't really want to deal with an initial condition or an arbitrary constant it has a 2 in it and so what we can do here it's because you have a lot of cancelling out of it what we can do here is you multiply both sides by 2 right now we can even get rid of that negative as long as you don't solve for the arbitrary constant first this is something that you can redefine as an arbitrary constant of C you can't do that if you solve for your arbitrary constant first so there there's some nuances in how we do this you've seen me solve for the arbitrary constant like right away with an initial value problem you've seen me do some stuff with logarithm so you've seen me wait a little bit it's really up to you look at the problem say the problems see what's going to benefit you because I'm going to hang on to a the C to the very end I want it to be as simple as possible so I'm getting rid of my negative I'm getting rid of that too I'm going to say let's call this thing the arbitrary constant and now when I solve for it when I say hey my initial value would happen at a time of zero that's gonna say that when T is zero this thing still goes to zero even though it's not just T it's native to T but who cares it's still going to zero I'm going to get 1 over X of 0 minus 1 squared and that's gonna be negative 2 times 0 plus C that says that our C it's no longer arbitrary it's based on an initial value it's 1 over X of 0 minus 1 squared now we're gonna solve for X but we're gonna wait to plug that in that's going to be like our our little secret guy over here that we're gonna solve for X from here but we're going to wait to plug in C that's right here till the very end now one thing I don't want to do I don't want to start going back up here and solve for X except for you to find that right so I've modified this problem to get an arbitrary constant I've solved for this C so you have to use this to solve for X you can't be going back because you're talking about different constants there you'd be altering altering this constant its it would no long be the same so since I based my arbitrary constant find that initial value from this particular formula I'm going to use this particular formula to solve for X what that means if we have something very similar we've done we're going to reciprocate both sides so here we have this X minus 1 squared would equal 1 over C minus 2 T so I switch this around we reciprocated both sides now we've got to take a square root we've got to add one and you know what happens when you take a square root on both sides shouldn't you have a plus and minus yeah you should when you take a square root on both sides you should have plus and minus positive negative square root that's what these graphs are kind of look like I hope that you're seeing the horizont of the vertical shift here's not one here's a square root function that's positive or negative it's going to give us a different look here and this is just an approximation what it looks like this is the actual graph and now we're ready to plug in back the arbitrary constant that's not arbitrary longer so a couple things at scene number one I don't need the square root of one I can simplify that I'm not sure I've wanted yet I'll tell you why in just a moment so I'm going to leave that the square root because we're going to end up getting based on this see say 1 over X of 0 minus 1 squared - - teeth the reason why I'm not simplifying that one is because if I if I did I'd have to go ahead and make this under a square root anyhow what I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the LCD of that complex fraction that's going to multiply it by one and since I left this in the square root it's really easy to see that this square root that square should cancel that's kind of nice and we'll leave it just like that this will distribute cancel here but I'm gonna have this minus 2t or two exit zero minus one squared times T so using just a little bit of simplification here we're going to still have a 1 so plus and minus will still have a square root but inside that square root we're gonna have an X of zero minus one squared all over distribute it'll cancel but will give us a one not a 0 so one cancel minus two X of zero minus one squared and we'd still have a team let me check my work here I multiply it by one I get that it's going to cancel I've multiplied a distribution on this expression of cancel that got two X of zero minus one squared times T that looks really good now we're going to talk about one last thing and get a 1 plus or minus would have an X so 0 minus 1 all over a big square root of 1 minus 2 X of 0 minus 1 squared that's a hot as good as we can get if you go any further you have to get a common denominator so it looking really nasty we really don't want to do that but this shows us what's gonna really be going on with our our general solution so what we've done is we've used some general curves to represent what's going to happen around our our critical points whether we're spouting or funneling or semi-stable or not but when we solve this we get that actual look of our curves so I hope that's making sense I'm drawing these just on the top yeah just kind of given you a look of it the curse and cells are gonna be different which is why it's important to solve these all the way down and say hey this is what it really really looks like okay it depends on what your initial value is if it's less than one yes we're going to be decreasing but how we're decreasing might not look exactly like that if we have an initial condition created in one yes we're going to be increasing but how we're increasing might not look exactly like that this is what those curves will look like depending on what your initial value is I hope that makes sense I'm going to come back in just a moment we're gonna do three very quick examples on just getting critical points showing you whether they're stable semi stable unstable and what the graph should look like so they'll be very very quick I'll be right back alright last three we're just gonna get approximations of what our general solution looks like and keep that in mind the the pictures we're getting are approximations so we're getting a general feel for how our general solution would look the curves themselves will look decidedly different quickly through these just to get a picture of whether the following spouting or semi-stable when we talk about solving a differential equation itself and getting the general the general solution it will give you the picture of those graphs for real all right I'm just giving you a picture of how it could look just the going away or going to some sort of a critical point so please keep that in mind these are approximations of our general solution but they're valuable they can allow you to check your work real quick what they can also do is tell you what should happen in a in a model of some sort of a population so it is useful to be able to understand that this gives you a picture of a kind of approximation of a general solution we're gonna do them very quickly the idea here is let's find critical points let's determine whether we're increasing or decreasing line intervals it's going to give us a look of a general solution or about that so since this is the first derivative all we've got to do is set our first derivative equal to zero to do a first derivative test now we're going to be factoring a lot because by factoring our slope is based on a quadratic which it is here then a zero product property says that our critical point would be four and one if we put them in order and we do a first derivative test let's plug in some values now we can do a couple things about this to make this easier you can plug in three values like 0 2 & 5 or you can use multiplicity to show what's gonna happen you see when you solve quadratic what's gonna have to happen so that is a quadratic right what's gonna have to happen is if you cross a zero quadratics look like that two of these are going to be positive and the middle one is going to be negative or the minimums gonna be positive the outside you're gonna be negative they have to alternate in other words so we can do that two ways well with multiplicity or one with understanding quadratics so if you plug in zero and you say hey when I plug in 0 I get a positive then this has to alternate and this has to alternate and you can try this on your own plug in 2 I'd see 9 so start leaning to 4 minus 10 plus will be negative decreasing plug in 5 25 positive we'd be increasing you can do that you'd also look at multiplicity since this is a factor with a power one and in fact over the power one multiplicity says that on opposite sides of that zero that critical point you will have different signs which means that here we have different signs positive and negative that tells us one side of the increasing one decreasing here you'd have different signs if that's decreasing on the other side is increasing you can use some of those things from like a college algebra class to do this very quickly sufficient forget about that stuff but it is still it very useful anyhow this is what whether you're going to plug in three numbers use multiplicity use the fact that's but paraboloids have just talked about all three parabolas alternate their continuous functions or use multiplicity we talked about opposite signs for odd powered or for multiplicity that's odd well to talk about discipline three numbers zero two and five anyway you go about it this interval is going to give us particular solutions all which are increasing this interval is going to give us particular solutions all which are decreasing this interval gives us particular solutions all legit increasing we have a stable and unstable critical point a funnel and a spout you've seen it before everything would be increasing starting with an initial value less than 1 between 1/4 we'd be decreasing so typically these things look like this and then above that we would be increasing and we can see this funnel idea and this spell idea around those particular critical points that's a very very loose approximation of what a general solution would be for that differential equation but it gives us an idea since it says ultimately hey if your initial value is greater than 4 just think about what's gonna happen your population it's gonna explode what happens if your population is between 1 and 4 it doesn't matter where you are and after certain amount of time you're going to drop to 1 the population is going to have a carrying capacity of 1 if you start below 1 you're going to increase until you - once you have a limiting population of 1 so that's valuable how it actually happens you need to solve the difference equation to model a particular solution based on this value but the general gives you a general look and our approximation that says here's what's gonna happen ultimately the next one so what happens if I just change the signs well let me ask you that what happens if you change a parabola to have a negative sign in front of it upward opening parabola is positive in front down by opening parabolas with negative friends so instead of a increase decrease increase we should get a decrease increase decrease the signs will still alternate it's still a parabola when we factor this thing you're still going to have multiplicity 1 which means an opposite sides of that zero office size that critical point you will have different signs so we are going to have to prove a point two and five notice how this sign hasn't absolutely nothing to do with these factors ok these factors are set equal to zero themselves by the zero power property you don't take this sign and change these values now what it says for our first derivative test they said if I pull against something like zero again which we talk about three ways to think about it this is a parabola so you have to have alternating signs this would be multiplicity 1 and multiplicity 1 so on opposite sides of your critical point you'd have different values or just plug in three numbers plug in something like zero now when you do it do do it anywhere do do it in any of these I would say probably here's the easiest zero plus zero minus 10 that's a negative you are going to be have a negative slope for every particular solution that has an initial value less than two and say that again it's very important very worried the slope of every particular solution on this interval or the soap of every particular solution depend on whether your initial condition is less than two is going to be negative every one of those particular solutions will be decreasing this will alternate so plug in three see negative nine twenty one and negative positive every one of these particular solutions if your initial value starts between two to five not at two or five those are equilibrium solutions and that they will change at those values but every particular solution with an initial value between two and five whether the positive slope it will be increasing and lastly plug in something like six your plug in six negative 36 or two that's going to be negative so every particular solution with the initial value greater than five is going to be negative so or be decreasing this says that that is an unstable critical point that's a spout this is a stable critical point that's a funnel and what's going to give us is this approximation of a general solution saying hey start below two what's going to happen you're kind of decrease start between two and five what's going to happen you're going to increase start above five what's gonna happen you're going to decrease we're going to get this spout for the bottom prove a point and a funnel for the top critical point and again this can tell you what a population we do in order function we'll be doing it all depends on where you start start below two you're going to go extinct start between two and five your population is going to grow until you reach the vibe that's going to be a limiting population start above file your population is going to decline until you reach to five that's a carrying capacity and so this gives us a model what is going to happen without having to solve a differential equation now to find the actual curve so then you can really model you have to solve that and get in particular solution depending on your initial value so I hope it's making sense I hope that you're with me on hey critical points mean something right now you certain some facts of parabolas or multiplicity or just plugging numbers to find out what your general solution would be looking like okay last one but this is kind of similar to the last problem we did before these two except instead of something minus 2 we have a 2 minus the variable so let's see what happens with that one without having to do any solving with separable equations here well we would know that if this is our function and it represents a slope so we have only one critical point two now that's it let's see that's a cubic how to cubic look they don't care it's a multiplicity three our slope is cubic multiplicity 3 says that on different sides of our odd multiplicity different sides of a critical one will have different values so on one side will be positive and the other side will be negative they will be different not the same so if we take a look at my first derivative test and I plug in something like zero to my function I plug in zero I'm going to get a positive which says that every solution with an initial value less than two is going to be increasing positive so it's increasing greater than two something like three because of multiplicity because of the the cubic I'm going to have a different value at a different sign here so plug in three I'm going to get a negative it says that every particular solution of this differential equation has a mission of ID greater than two it's going to be decreasing every single one of them that gives us a stable critical point that's going to give us a funnel what that looks like for us that's Gandhi is that at x equals two through x equals two come on letter x equals two we have an equilibrium solution if we start an initial value of two that population whatever this is this function will not change let me start below that it will increase until we reach two if we start above that it will decrease until we reach two that's it it's as much as we need to go on this one so I hope that I've made it very clear on the interplay between a first derivative and a differential first order differential equation that they're they're representing the same thing but going backwards from a differential equation you're not quite sure exactly what you're your original function looks like and so we get a general solution and it's dependent on what our initial value is very dependent on that we can get an approximation by just doing the first derivative test but to get the real picture we got to go ahead and solve our differential equation and we'd have to know an initial value because that's gonna dictate what a graph is actually doing also I hope that I can refresh your memory on how to deal with some of your sign analysis understanding multiplicity and the shape of your graphs so I hope it's made sense I know it's a long video I hope that you were with me the whole time next time what we'll talk about is we'll take a look at some some different examples as as far as harvesting and stalking is concerned and how that affects what's what's going on we'll talk about bifurcation point what that even means for right now if you've understood how to get these graphs from your differential equation you're doing creative so I'll see you for another video hope you're doing well see you soon you
