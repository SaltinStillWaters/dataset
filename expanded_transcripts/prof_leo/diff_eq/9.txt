Transcript for: Applications of Slope Fields (Differential Equations 10)
so now that we have a feel about what slope fields are let's try to use them in an application a little bit more realistic than just drawing slopes everywhere and figure out what curve goes through it this will give you an idea of what goes on in some real-life problems using differential equations so again let's start off with some sort of application let's if it's tough about slope fields and we'll get this this picture what's really going on with our situation so a lot of times in some of the simplified word problems you're used to we neglect things like wind resistance which isn't really realistic if you jump out of like let's say a helicopter before you jump on a helicopter okay so go don't jump up because it's spinning but let's say you jump out of the helicopter well you're gonna fall now that makes sense that if you if you jump downward you're gonna fall faster and if you just kind of fall out you're gonna fall slower but when you think about how wind resistance works if we just had gravity and and no wind resistance yeah we pick up velocity until we smash them to the ground or pull the parachute but if we have wind resistance as our gravity is pulling us down at a constant acceleration our velocity is increasing yeah but our acceleration is not we're falling down well we're picking up velocity and as we pick up that velocity we encounter more air resistance wind resistance we encounter this this force upward of the wind holding us up or pushing us up so gravity's going this way but the air resistance is actually a counter force pushing us up and it depends on on your velocity so as it turns out if we have how our velocity is changing that's acceleration remember that the way that velocity is changing the rate of change of our velocity with respect to time that's acceleration well in previous examples like simplified versions we would just do this and we go yeah we're accelerating from gravity wind resistance but we do have resistance so if we look at the way that velocity is changing perspective time our acceleration it is the acceleration of gravity - so that's downward so acceleration to gravity let's consider that gravity is pulling us down air resistance is opposite of that so our air resistance is some proportional constant like K but it's proportional to our velocity so the constant proportionality is K that's some sort of a number that's based on whatever the object is that's falling so we have a larger body or something would be encountered more air resistance than like an arrow or a bullet or something and but it is proportional to velocity so the faster you are going the more air resistance you encountered we know that right out because if we're standing still you're not feeling any resistance but if you were running twenty miles an hour that'd be really fast you would feel a lot of wind against you or if you stick your hand out of a moving car then you're gonna feel that that wind against your hand so the and the faster you go the more wind that you feel well then that's pushing us upwards as a force that's acting upwards so in real life our acceleration the rate of change of velocity respective time is yes gravity gravitational constant but - the air resistance I hope that makes sense to you so G is that gravity and it's the constant of acceleration for gravity k is the this this idea of you have a proportionality of air resistance so now and that would be objects specific so whatever you are throwing out or dumping out or jumping out that that K is gonna change you know what object you or considering their resistance for so here's the idea and this is what I really want to get get out of this if you just consider the gravitational acceleration so 32 feet per second squared and so every second that you're going you're increasing your velocity or 32 feet per second well if you don't consider air resistance yeah we pick up velocity until we smash into the ground but if we have air resistance something pushing up against us at some point check this out at some point G will equal K times V somewhere along this line this is going to equal this look that's a constant that's not changing we're on earth it's always the same gravity yeah it does change as we get away from the earth but not not by much so that's constant if that's a constant and we hold that constant and this increases as velocity goes up so so you dump something out of the helicopter it's gonna pick up speed as it picks up speed it gets more and more and more air resistance against it so the way our velocity is changing our acceleration is constant but this is growing as time goes on that's growing at some point these two things will be equal well if you subtract to equal things what do you get you get zero so at some point our acceleration the way that our velocity is changing will be zero it means our velocity won't be changing any more let me explain that one more time so you throw something out your velocity is going to change that's acceleration how your loss is changing so the rate of change of velocity with respect to time your acceleration is G minus air resistance so right at the beginning you just have G but your velocity starts going up you're going to gain air resistance so that's pushing against your acceleration that's pushing against your the body and it's going to slow your acceleration if that's constant and that's growing your acceleration diminishes to the point where at some point you're getting zero acceleration that doesn't mean your velocity zero that means though that your velocity is not changing so at some point you're going to hit a terminal velocity or some people call that a limiting velocity for speed related type problems we're going to hit that and we're going to see that in our slope field so without any specific techniques on how to solve these things we can come up with a slope field to describe the situation so one last time yeah we're jumping out yes the way the loss of change spec times called acceleration gravity is a constant but the the proportionality of your air resistance is is it's proportional to well your air resistance is proportional to plus the faster you go the more wind pushes against you at some point you're going to reach this where the way that air resistance is forcing up is equal to how gravity is pulling down that's going to that's going to be your limiting velocity so when that happens it's gonna be your limiting velocity and we're gonna check that out so let's say let's explore one so let's say that this is our situation we're gonna jump out of a helicopter and that right there that's gravity that's 32 feet per second squared we have found somehow the constant of variation or how we're proportional is this constant of 1.6 times whatever velocity you're traveling that's gonna be how our wind resistance is affecting us let's say this is us jump down so if we have a first order differential equation we know that this means slope so first derivative means so that means our slope is 32 minus one point six V the where's-where's fatigue remember that velocity is already a function of time so velocity is changing with respect to time the T is wrapped up in that that's our dependent variable but T's in there somehow so all we really need is velocity what that means is this is going to be weird but as our time goes on these numbers are not going to change there's no place to even plug in T ve already has all the t's in it so I hope you've got to do is go plug in zero if we plug in zero for our V and here's all of our T's plug in zero you're gonna get 32 and that's not going to change our T doesn't affect that our velocity is already already has those it's already bunch of T it already has those T's in effect that plug into five what we get if we plug in five we get 24 so 32 minus one point six times five if we plug in 10 well that's 32 minus 16 so we need 16 all the way down if we plug in 15 32 minus 1 point 6 times 15 gives us 8 if we plug in 20 we're gonna get 0 this is what you're looking for and if you continue this this is negative 8 and negative 16 you know if you were watching for the this slope field video the one right before this we had diagonals that weren't changing that happens a lot when you have like X is plus or minus wise this when they're your x I did a variable on here you're going to get these verticals that aren't changing happens and I know that you can plug in 40 and do 30 minus 1.6 times 40 and get these these same exact numbers I'm getting so let's make all this makes sense before we do our slope field and look at what's going to happen on the on our graph so we know that in real life we get air resistance that means that when you jump out you're going to reach some sort of limiting velocity at some point your air resistance is going to meet up with acceleration of gravity if you're jumping high enough and don't get the ground first or or polar parachute or something they're gonna be equal that means that you're not going to be changing your velocity after that you had this zero change as zero acceleration means that you will have a constant constant velocity at that point so this is what that does this says if you jump out it used fall so your initial velocity is zero you're not jumping downwards you're in a helicopter right so you're probably not gonna jump up because there's a blade that would be a negative initial velocity so if you jump down with negative five you're gonna probably hit the propeller you don't want to do that so this would be jumping downward so if we jump out at zero so just fall well initially we're going to be going this 30 - oh well let me let me say that and say this is they will see this on our arm picture we're going to be increasing our velocity at this 32 feet per second if we jump out of five does it make sense that if you jump out going downward you're going to immediately encountered air resistance immediately that means that your rate of change of velocity is going to be slower you've already jumped out at five feet per second so the rate at which you're changing is a little bit slower now let's say you jump out of ten you're jumping downward at ten feet per second already the reign of changing to be slower you've encountered that air resistance immediately here you did it that's why we're Exelero that's why our velocity is changing faster here no here no here a little bit little bit slower now what about 20 and 20 if you jump downward at 20 feet per second right from the get go out of this helicopter your rate of change isn't going to be anything at all you've encountered just enough air resistance to meet up with your gravity so this is weird and we're gonna see it on the picture but if you jumped out of this helicopter at 23 per second you're not gonna feel your velocity increase or decrease you will have immediately met your limiting velocity that's wild now let's say that you jump out faster than that let's say that you jumped down wow I just really wanna get on a helicopter and you're jumping down at 25 feet per second you're actually going to slow down so if you're jumping faster than your limiting velocity air resistance is pushing up more than gravity he's pulling you down should kind of slow down that that's the same principle like when you when you shoot if you shot a gun downward so it's at some point your guns going so fast that it's a it's meeting so much air resistance that gravity's not gonna overcome that your air resistance is pushing up more than gravity's pulling that down you have an initial velocity there that's so fast it's counting so much air resistance it's going to slow that bullet down even though you shouldn't downward that's what's happening here so you jumped out at forty feet per second downwards that really pushing it you're gonna encounter so much air resistance that that's pushing you up more than the gravity is pulling you down that's weird but that's what this is gonna play on us so long story made real short we have air resistance it's proportional to your velocity and we can show the picture of it really kind of nicely this point where we have a zero change that is called your limiting velocity or terminal velocity or when we talk about population will get like this population limiting factor layer carrying capacity something that limits how much we can grow if you're below that you're going to increase if you're above that you're gonna decrease until you find this leveling spot this limit so let's put these slows remember these are all slopes how our velocity is changing is right here let's put them on our graph let's see what happens again we made the grid it's a lot easier to use so because our time isn't affected well our time is affecting our our velocity but it's wrapped up in the velocity itself so four times zero one two three four we're gonna have these these intersections of time and velocity so zero zero right down here we have a slope of 32 but that's really steep I'm not gonna really build it draw that as not a vertical line that's gonna be darn near a vertical line 32 rise over run but also at so here's our velocity so 0 5 10 15 20 years of times 1 through 6 so at 0 0 we got 32 at equals one and velocity zero we also have thirty-two at T equals two and velocity zero will get 32 so all along this velocity of zero we have a slope with 32 this is acts like a diagonal notice not bad no but this does not change darn your vertical lines now as we bump it up to five our velocity goes to five feet per second then our slope starts to two not starts to decrease from 32 and we talked about why that was so you jump out with an initial velocity you immediately encountered air resistance which means your velocity can't change as drastically as it did if you jump down at zero at zero you have no air resistance for a little while that means that you're going to increase velocity faster because you're it's only gravity that's affecting you as you increase speed you start encountering air resistance so the way your velocity is changing can't be as drastic is if you didn't have air resistance so the more air resistance you have the less that your acceleration of gravity can take over here we get 24 so all along this level we have 24 at 10:00 we have 16 at 15 mm 8 at 20 we have zero and that is just as that should be striking to be like oh well hobby obviously if our spokes are really no matter where where our soaps are gonna increase we're gonna go uh we're gonna level out right here so if we and this is what is saying to you as we're looking our soap field that's this isn't this is important because if models real-life concepts really really well that's what so people to do that's how we want to use them if you jump out at any velocity up to twenty feet per second going downward you're going to increase your velocity gravity is going to overcome your air resistance until you reach that point and then you're gonna level out if you jump out faster than twenty feet per second down so let's see 25 you get negative eight at thirty we have negative sixteen so in mirrors this and putting this all together our slope field gives us how are our velocity is changing with respect to time if we jump out or fall out or are putting an initial velocity that's slower than 20 feet per second this is all saying that yeah you're going to increase until you reach that level if you jump out that faster so going down we're jumping downward at faster than 20 feet per second you're actually going to slow down here gravity is overcoming your air resistance until you hit 20 here air resistance is overcoming your gravity so this would be bigger than gravity that's what you're slowing down what we what's gonna happen though is that these two things are gonna level out in real life your air resistance and your gravity are going to come to some sort of equilibrium an equilibrium solution that's what this is the the solution where if you started at 20 so 20 feet per second you jump out you're jumping down route 23 per second you are not gonna feel a change so it's not gonna feel like you're increasing speed it's not gonna feel like you're decreasing speed check out slower than that it's gonna feel like you're speeding up because gravity's pulling you faster than your air resistance when you start to a point to that that level of 20 feet per second where we even out here if you're jumping faster than that so jump me down we're faster than that you're going to feel like you are slowing down your slope is negative here you're gonna be decreasing your velocity until you reach that equilibrium until you reach that limiting velocity in that weird it's kind of cool so right here this this 20 that right there is our limiting velocity no matter what happens whether you jump out whether you're pushed out jump downward whatever you're going to reach that velocity given enough time so let's kind of interesting we'll figure out how much time you really need again you're not going to jump up so don't have a negative velocity not gonna jump upward because of the helicopter idea so our limit is this 20 feet per second so let's say that we let's say that we jump down at 0 so so we start here so remember from our our slope fields that we had an initial condition and starting spot of 0 0 so at x 0 we're not traveling any we're just jumping down when I choking downward let's see how fast we actually come up to that that 20 feet per second so starting starting here remember that slope fields that they've got to find this curve that matches these slopes so we're starting really steep when we get to this level we better have a slope of positive 24 so when we hit 5 we gotta have a slope of 24 when we hit 10 we've gotta have a son of 16 then 8 then 0 this right here looks like it's about seventeen and a half or something so we reach 17 and a half feet per second after only two seconds so we go from 0 to 17.5 feet per second in 1/2 that's like well what is that that's a good percentage of 23 per second when we if you divide that so do set about 70 and a half divided by 20 that's a percentage of that limiting velocity that you reach after two seconds so you can find out how long it's going to take you to reach a certain percentage of 20 now theoretically do you ever reach 20 it's an asymptote so technically no or theoretically no but that's the limit so you're going to get to that point get closer and closer and closer but but you're never going to exceed that that velocity you can only limit to it wild now let's say you jumped out it at 40 same thing happens in Reverse you're gonna slow down until you reach your limiting velocity I hope this is making sense to you it's very interesting the way that works in real life because at some point when you really do think about it gravity and air resistance if you're jumping up faster than gravity slow down you're jumping up slower than gravity you're gonna speed up but that air resistance is forcing you backwards so when you're when you're when you're self when you're jumping up so fast air is just this is overcoming gravity when jumping out so slow gravity's overcoming air resistance but some what they mean that's what we're talking about with an equal image solution you jumped out of twenty that can feel change faster slurring that you're gonna reach that limiting velocity we're gonna do one more example about population will talk about limiting population or carrying combat capacity so hang on for that one I'd like to walk you through one more example about population we're gonna do this very quickly the idea is exactly the same I just want to show you how slope can do some funny things in the middle of this this problem to show you that on the slope field and to talk about something called carrying capacity so so when we look at this we have the way that that a population is changing with respect to time now again we don't have a T up here but the population itself is a function of time and so the way that population is changed or you think of it the acceleration of population that's kind of weird but how fast is the population growing or decreasing well that's given by this for a certain population with TB months now because we don't have a team in here our slope is still equal this here is the slope of the population the way the populations change with respect to time is still equal to this but there's no T involved the P hat is a function of time already so it's it's involved in that population well if we want to go ahead and do a slope field our slope is given by this function of P a function of T with our dependent variable P in there let's just start plugging in initial populations so what if we started zero well okay 0-0 these are all going to be zero do you see that it's not gonna change as far as what time we have we're gonna have zero this whole way down same thing happens for all this I'm just going to be one number if we start with ten our slope would be point two all the way down if we start with twenty point three three would be our slope start with thirty point for our slope start with forty point for to move your so let's start with fifty point 0.38 and usse know something funny kind of happening so our slope is increasing and then it starts decreasing again that's a very interesting than 60 would be point two seven 75 would be zero you're looking for that and then 80 would be negative point one two here's what this is saying this would be all the way down for all of these remember my goal in teaching you this not just how to do it understanding what's going on if this is the way that the population is changing what this says is that if you start with these populations here's what is going to happen if you start with a population of zero are you gonna see any growth probably not there's nothing to grow if you start with a population of ten whatever this population size is you're going to immediately start seeing a population increase twenty increase thirty increase faster for to increase faster and that should make sense right because if you have more things to reproduce the population should be growing faster to a point because our natural resources aren't limitless which means that as we get closer and higher and higher our population is growing but not as fast because we're reaching some sort of factor here at some point we hit what's called in carrying capacity so you start with 75 units of population whatever that is it's not gonna grow it's not gonna fall it's limited if you start with more than that you're gonna actually have a die-off if you put say you've had a really small pond and you just you don't zero fish in no Fisher code you go okay that they don't just spontaneously come about listen make sense if you dump in way too many fish like a billion fish in a really small pond there's not enough resource just a lot of them are going to die so as we start having our population go higher and higher and higher it makes sense that at some point or not you'll be able to grow anymore in fact we're going to start dying off because there's just too much of this population in one spot there's a middle ground that because if you start low and it's gonna grow you start high it's gonna die that's both wrong that's kinda fun then at some point there's this equilibrium solution and that's what that 75 does that's zero right there look positive slopes negative slopes there's got to be a zero that right there that's your carrying capacity that means that no matter whether you start lower than zero or higher you are going to level off you're going to limit yourself to that 75 popular units of population whatever that is and the picture is gonna bear that out so I'm just really quickly but at zero zero we have of course zero and if we had a population start at zero we're gonna zero all the way no matter what if we start up with ten so we're gonna have this part of this is slope with 0.2 so all the way along get a little point to slope and we're going to increase until we get to 40 populations start on initial population of 40 units I'm kind of exaggerating my slope right now so you see what's going on but then once we get to 50 please start to slow down so the most rapid growth that we have is right around start with 40 you start with that much if you have a lot of things or whatever these beans are to reproduce and you but you have enough resources to make it sustainable when we get over that if we start slowing back down then even slower and probably even so I don't have this listed here I'm missing my 70 I don't want to put that out there but even slower 70s point one of you on them to the point where we have zero and above that we have a negative soul so if you're looking at your slope field that looks like this this should be really telling what's going on if you start with a population of zero you are not going to see any growth obviously if you start with just slightly more than that it's going to grow slowly at first but then as our time moves on look how our curve has to flow through this slope field so it seems like well time doesn't matter it does matter but it's just like you're starting at a different level here population wise so if we start at zero and we have no population no matter what our time is we have zero that that is an equilibrium solution but it's not a good one I mean it's like it's like the trivial solution you know yeah it's it's nothing it's like the same you're gonna launch a basket where you launch a rocket from the ground at time zero it's on the ground when's the rocket on the ground and time zero Thanks I meant like after it's all done once it hit the ground so if you start with no population obviously you're not gonna have when I'm at one time but if you start with just higher than that you are gonna flow along this curve you're a mattress slopes up but eventually you're gonna level off if you start higher you just gain quicker but you're gonna level off if you start lower yeah my team may take you a long time to finally reach that because you don't have as many many reproducing items if you start way higher what you're actually gonna drop this is like what the last example your gravity to overcome in your air resistance or your air resistance overcoming your gravity this is the same thing your level of food is overcoming your population which means you can grow or your populations overcoming your level of fitness called food which means your population is going to decrease you'll have enough so that's the way that these slope fields work they're looking for the 0 that 0 is typically your carrying capacity or your limiting velocity for speed problems or your equilibrium solution if you start with that so if we started with 75 units of population you wouldn't change if you started with let's say 10 at time 0 make sure you're hitting these slopes as you're moving forward we travel along but eventually we are in love allowed so how you can figure out things like how fast would it take you to hit 90 percent of your or 75 percent of your your limiting capacity or the two thirds or whatever and just look for where you reach let's say 60 a level of 60 that happens when do I hit a level of 60 let's go if I start at 10 if I start at 10 units population well that would mean that I did right around the 60 months or so they said 48 15 somewhere 48 60 months so the whole idea of soap fields one last time as last we're gonna really talk about it so fields model hopefully some realistic examples that you can't or maybe aren't able to solve with different equations right now or maybe even ever what they do is they consider a first derivative to be the slope which we have they say that's the formula for your slope no problem I can just plug in some points I got it then it's gonna give you a slope at every point the whole picture is your general solution so every possible curve would happen fit these slopes so this is your general solution it tells us a lot about situations though if you just look at the slopes it goes about that's your that's your limiting factor right there so if you start with the population 75 you ain't gonna grow if you jump out of the helicopter 20 feet per second year I'm not gonna fall any faster so they tell us a lot about a situation just by looking at it to get a specific curve you need a starting point so you could say I'm going through this point and then you can find a particular solution that's how all initial conditions work any way this condition gives us a particular solution a lot of times we can see what's our trends in in gaining or losing and how that would really affect our real life situation so I'm I'm hopeful that this is making sense to you I'm hoping that you see the the niceness about this that you can approximate solutions without actually having to do anything with the problem that's pretty cool computers do this really well and what's nice about it is remember that whole talk about how we have this trade-off between perfectly modeling the situation and doing the math behind it well if you've got computers you can kind of do both you can perfectly model situation and then do a slope field and it will show you a lot of trends in it I'll show you limiting capacities are limiting limiting factors or carrying capacities or limiting velocities and include more variables even though United will solve it and that's that's pretty neat so I hope this makes sense I hope that right now you're able to take a slope from a difference of the equation make up a table to get yourself a slope field and interpret what's going on look at how slowly we go we start low or how quickly we decline if we start high look and think about how that would make sense in a real life event with low populations we'd grow slowly but as we get more and more population we start living ourselves because of resources to a point where we're going to level off just enough resources to support us but not grow any more you start too high there's not enough resources to support and we would decline population that's what so feels about is interpreting real-life situations so next time what we're going to talk about is how to determine when we're when we're gonna have solutions or not so so fields one way to deal with it when we don't have a solution but now we're going to start determining when we do have solutions and when we can expect a unique one so we'll talk about that and then after that we start dealing with solving techniques it just gave me fun you
