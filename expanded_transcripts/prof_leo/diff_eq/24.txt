Transcript for: Solving Differential Equations with Embedded Derivative Substitutions (Differential Equations 24)
time for another technique on how to solve some of these first-order differential equations now I want to say this before we get going on it that sometimes more than one technique is possible to solve some of these differential equations and we've actually already seen that but now this technique is going to come back and say there's some problems that we did on it with Bernoulli equations or with homogeneous that this works really nicely on in the next video I'm gonna revisit five of those and they're gonna be five of the problems of like wow that was really tough with homogeneous or that was really tough with Bernoulli and it's a piece of cake with this so this technique called embedded derivatives it's it's really cool it's so it's thinking outside of the box it's not fitting these differential equations to a specific take technique but it's looking for a piece in this differential equation that we can work with and here's how it works so when we talk about these embedded derivatives or when we're looking for an embedded derivative what we're looking for is in a differential equation do you have a piece of it then it's the derivative of another piece because if you do well maybe we can write rewrite this dy/dx with this function as DV DX by everybody making a little substitution so embedded derivatives this technique still does a substitution but it's looking for something very specific it's saying do you have a piece of your differential equation that is a derivative of another piece now here's what it has to have into it so look for a piece that's a derivative another piece it has to include a Y so here's a it here's we're going to be going this is how once your brain structures so when we get there it makes sense to you we're gonna be picking a function of Y that we're gonna call V alright so function of y equals V take a derivative we'll get a DP DX we'll get a function of Y that's a derivative but then we'll get dy DX by the chain rule wait a minute if you picked this function of Y so that the derivative of that is also in your differential equation then when we take a derivative this should give us this piece over here with the dy ix by the chain rule and that's gonna clear clean up a ton of this differential equation for us it's a very cool technique now it doesn't work every time well no of course not because we don't always have two functions away we don't always have a function of Y that's a derivative a direct derivative of another piece or we can't make it into that so we use it when we can but it doesn't happen every single time so I'm gonna walk you through how it works when we get to use it but if you do see it man use it because it's gonna save you a lot of time as far as manipulating your difference equation try to fit like Bernoulli or homogeneous or something like that so let's go ahead so then or will replace our dy/dx not with just D what sorry replace not just dy/dx but an entire function dy/dx so one more time all the way to through we're looking for a piece that's a derivative of another piece of Y when we call the piece that's not the derivative V okay why let's take a derivative we'll replace not just dy/dx but an entire function with it let's check this out of this example we'll do about four more after this this one's really kind of basic just to get our feet wet and then we'll get through it so look at the difference of equation and it is one man it doesn't look whether you're there's not even really an X up there I don't want to start making this homogeneous it's not a basic integration it's not separable it doesn't look like doesn't even look Bernoulli because they don't have Y to the first power so what in the world am I going to do let's look for an embedded derivative maybe that's one of the first techniques we would check out because here's what we're looking for we're looking for a function that is the derivative of another function that's what we're looking for it to a piece of this differential equation that is a derivative of another piece and it has to have Y's in it that looks pretty good now here's how this is going to work if we call this piece of be the piece that you're not sorry the piece that's not the derivative so let's let it be equal Y to the third think about what is going to happen the reason why this technique is because if this piece is the derivative of this piece then if I call this V and I take a derivative of this piece well what's going to happen well not only am I going to get this whole thing back because this is the derivative of that but I'm also going to get dy/dx by the chain rule so let's take a derivative on the left hand side we get DV DX great on the right hand side we get 3y squared no problem but then do you.why any X and this is the magic of this this technique it says wait a minute you mean to tell me you're gonna wrap them all your Y's all at once yeah that's right let's Y includes the Y so if you wrap up all your Y's all at once in terms of V this is really nice for us so what do we start replacing these things we know that Y cube is gonna be V so this was V no problem we take a derivative obviously the piece that's a derivative it's gonna show up so 3y squared I mean stirrers right there but more than that that attainable we get this dy/dx we can replace this like in mass this whole thing this is great so this entire piece of junk right here we're gonna replace with DV DX so this entire piece that whole piece is now DV DX Plus do we have a like cube anymore no that's what we're calling V that's how we got this derivative in the first place do we need to worry about e to the negative X well no we don't because that's got X's in it's okay to have these and X's remember the idea on a lot of these substitutions is wrap up the Y's wrap up the Y's so that they become V's and DV DX and then we can integrate it in a different independence or e with a different dependent variable is V and then go back at the very end and that's where this technique really shines it says if you have a piece that's a derivative of another piece and in fact it's this whole thing really then you go okay let's call this piece V the one that's not the derivative that way when I take a derivative of it the other he shows up and the other piece is called DV DX so this it's dvdx this piece is what we called the this piece we don't even care and now hopefully this is going to change into something that we can use linear or separable or some other thing that we can make work so for us well let's see we're now in terms of B for our dependent variable IC to be x IC v to the first power I see a fun wait a minute that's money or let's see a bunch of X so what if we say you've X is 1 can we find it integrating factors so that we can solve this this linear differential equation in terms of B now yeah we don't row of X is going to be e to that integral of P of X that's EBX we don't need a plus C we've talked about Y let's multiply everything by that so both sides this entire equation by e to the X that's going to give us e to the X DP DX plus e to the X of e equals well if we multiply e to the negative x times e to the positive x now what's that going to give us what happened exponents is going to give us 0 that's one move up here so this side remember how the this whole linear idea works the whole linear differential equation idea works in you're using an integrating factor and we can use integrating factors in different ways this is just one way you can use them and you are using an integrating factor to create this result of a product rule so let's find the product if this is the result of a product rule but pieces here and here came from the original product well now we know we can integrate both side so if we integrate both sides with respect to X we're going to get e to the x times B equals integral of 1 DX oh cool all right that means that e to the x times B equals x plus C we got to have a see up there we know that when you integrate we get it plus C we don't need 1 for an integrating factor because e to the C would be divided away right away since you're multiplying every term by it now we do have to solve for V well how do we do that use it divided by e to the X or use e to the negative x that would work but now we realize one more thing with all of these substitution techniques that we're making with V we got to go back and get Y eventually so we're gonna go back right here the substitution we made just like before just like homogenius or any of those are the ones we use this twice we use it one time to get away from the Y's we use it another time to get back to the Y's so let's go back to the wise if v equals y cubed then y cubed equals it's X plus C e to the negative x that's the embedded derivative technique easy problem yeah and I'll show you some other ones that aren't as easy but man is it cool I hope you see in the utility in this so this is really an this is really impressive the fact that we have a piece that's a derivative of another piece we just call the piece that is not the derivative part so it's called the parent function you call that V then when you take a derivative of it yes you're gonna give the DV DX that's a substitution but you're also going to get the other piece that is the derivative with the dy/dx could replace the entire thing with DV DX very neat gives us linear in this case we can solve it down make sure you get back to Weis hope that's making sense to you let's do a few more examples all right let's get ready for another two we have a differential equation we're looking at it and it looks very similar last example but it doesn't look very similar to any of the techniques that we've used and so we're looking at it going i I don't know what to do with that well maybe we start looking outside the box instead of looking for a specific homogeneous substitution or an obvious substitution or bernoulli substitution let's look for an embedded derivative can do you see a piece of this ask yourself right now can you see a piece of this where you see one part of your different equation connected to a dy/dx equal to another part of your differential equation that has Y's in it remember with all of these substitution techniques we need to wrap up all of the Y's with it so it has to work with the Y's if it doesn't then this is not the right technique to use so we're looking for a piece of the differential equation connected to a dy/dx that's the derivative of another piece and we're going to make that substitution so that other piece the one that's not connected to the D by DX that's got to be your V so when we're looking at we're going well oh my gosh hey there's my cube that's great here's 3y squared dy DX that right there is the derivative of Y Q now what about the X don't worry about the felon guide or got that little guy don't worry about the X that's just gonna be x times DV DX can we divide by that yes are we gonna get a domain tissue yes and wanted to find it when we get there so when we're rewriting these things we are gonna get some domain issues and we'll start weaving that in right now but when we're taking a look at our our techniques if one doesn't fit you know maybe I try such a different technique and one of them that we can sometimes rely on just not all the time but sometimes why is this embedded derivative so let's start working through it we know this when I take a derivative of it gives us this let's call this piece beef let's take a derivative on both sides with respect to X I hope you've noticed this but this is awful like doing a substitution with with integrals so like a you saw or something when you look at you go okay I'm gonna replace this part with a variable I'm gonna take a derivative I'm gonna replace this entire thing with the DX all at once with that substitution that's exactly what we're doing here so when we're looking this going hey let's call this piece Y cube let's take a derivative oh my gosh it's just like the substitution technique integrals cool 3y squared dy DX let's look for this piece in my differential equation it's bright that's awkward right here so can I replace all of that stuff 3y squared dy DX with DV DX yes and that's how the embedded riveted technique works it says let's go ahead and replace all that so I'm gonna say 3 dy squared dy DX all of this junk is DV DX but what I didn't replace still needs to be there I still need to have that X on the right-hand side I didn't do anything with the 3 X to the fourth but that Y to the third power that's me so I'm gonna replace that with a V so again we're looking at this no technique looks apparent but I'm gonna try to think outside the box maybe a piece of this is a derivative another piece call the piece that you want to take the derivative of V take the derivative of it you should get the other piece dy DX so a couple things to look out for the derivative has to be connected to the dy/dx by multiplication I hope you understand why that is because when you put when you replace it you're replacing the derivative and the chain rule gives you a times dy/dx we need that to be the case so we're looking at it you need the derivative piece to be multiplied by the dy/dx somewhere other stuff can be around it like that X Factor no problem just multiply that or leave that when you multiply it by the DV DX well it's like that now that's differential equation hey we got rid of all the wives we wrapped up all the Y's would be we still have an X that's fine but this is DVD X instead of dy/dx do you see a variable raised to the first power in the dependent variable Y SUV that right there says this is gonna be a linear so this is a linear differential equation now in terms of V and X let's write it as such let's subtract the V yeah that's pretty cool now I've got almost a linear what's the next thing that I would do well to make a linear differential equation I need to divide by X because I need the DV DX by itself and so what it's going to give us is divided by X divided by X divided by X we need T V DX would get 1 over X V we get a 3 X cubed now I'm gonna start working this in right now you just divided by X and now it should be pretty clear on on the work that we're gonna have a domain issue what is that Dumanis you what can't X be well X can be 0 but because we're dealing with a linear I'm gonna bet that we're gonna have an integrating factor that's gonna have an Ln of absolute value of x to avoid that absolute value I'm just gonna make it greater than 0 we're gonna put a restriction or domain that we wouldn't get there and we have our integrating factor of Rho X and we go oh yeah it's not doing with the absolute value that's gonna take care of it for us so one more time all the way through we're looking for a piece that's a derivative another piece call it B take a derivative it should be up there call the whole thing DV DX got it leave anything else that's not in that derivative no problem and look at the form right now we have linear let's divide let's take this off to the side but just nice and neat and now let's go ahead and find an integrating factor let's multiply let's solve this so I know my P of X is negative 1 over X so when I integrate I have this e to the negative integral of 1 over X no province a negative well that gives us e to the negative Ln X where's the absolute value right there we said that's why we make those those domain restrictions so we don't have to deal with it later because we found out in linear then a lot of times we can start simplifying our X's but if one of them has an absolute value one doesn't that's an issue and it cost some other domain issues to come out so let's work with this one this is going to be e to the Ln 1 over X remember that we have a negative exponent we can move that up so X to the negative 1 sure but that's going to be let's see composition inverse functions Elleni are gone we'd get X to the negative 1 or 1 over X let's multiply that all three places so we had DV DX minus 1 over x times B equals 3x cubed and we're going to multiply both sides so we're in distribute by 1 over X and 1 over X and 1 over X let's simplify before we go any further the reason why we do that is because we know with linear we're trying to make this result of a product rule by using an integrating factor but on the right hand side you're just going to be integrating that and so we're gonna definitely simplify here but here we want to check our work remember that this this is the result of a product rule the derivative of this piece must be this piece in terms of X let's just make sure that happens so 1 over X cool DV DX no problem making it 1 over x squared times the B to the 1st it's the derivative of 1 over X equal to negative 1 or x squared yes ok now I know that that's going to be result of the project work equals in the right hand side 3x squared since this was linear since this is a result of product rule well let's find the product if this is the result of a budget rule it's leave the first 11 times the derivative of the second take the derivative the first times the second that had to be the product now we're good to go we know that integrals undo derivatives that's fantastic because we can just integrate both sides with respect to X on the left hand side we just get 1 over x times V on the right hand side we get X cubed plus C and this is what we're talking about is not really wanting an absolute value up here with our integrating factor because if we had that we'd have an absolute value here and here and here but not one over here and so we wouldn't be able to start multiplying by X and getting X to the fourth we won't be able to do that and so that's a lot of times why me let me do this we say let's just let X be greater than zero to avoid the absolute value of all together makes your simplification possible lets us use our technique very well let's go ahead and do is solve for V so that means that we're gonna multiply everything by X we can either get x times the quantity X cubed plus C or X to the fourth plus C times X now there's one more thing we've got to do the only other thing that we we really need here is that we've got to replace the V back and with these terms of y so we're going to look back at our substitution now let's see we use the substitution one time to get away from our Y's and one time to get back to our lives so V equals y to the third let's replace in that's about it we can write it just like that we could solve for y explicitly take a cube root of both sides if you want to either way is fine but I'm hoping that this is can sense as far as that the technique is concerned what we're looking for we're looking for a piece that when you take a derivative of it it's also in your function in your differential equation x dy/dx that that is the derivative we replace the whole function that's the derivative with DV DX and the function you took the derivative with v it'll lead to linear or some other form and then we go ahead and solve that and work back to get our rise at the end keep in mind we're gonna be dealing with some domain problems especially with linear especially when you're starting dividing so we're gonna get this X greater than zero quite a bit let's do the next one why don't you try right now as I'm erasing this just think through it's kind of a tough one but is there a piece up there in terms of Y but when I take the derivative of it it's there x dy/dx in some fashion other things can be multiplied along with it that's not a problem but we need at least the piece I'm going to substitute to have a derivative that's up there x dy/dx well here's a piece of Y x dy/dx is there anything up here that when I take the derivative of it somewhere else I get dy/dx yes and what about all this other junk taurima the other junk let's go ahead and replace that e to the Y this one with V alright well if we're going to do that what we need to do by DX hey we need to do by DX that's why this substitution has to have wine it like every other substitution we had it had to have a wine and so that we get a dy/dx is so that we can replace that guy with dy/dx so the whole thing works and then the piece that you're calling the V needs a derivative with respect to X that gives me a dy/dx it's got to be multiplied because the derivative here must repeat give me this it also has to be a dy/dx to give me this we replace the whole thing everything in your substitutions you should have caught on by now everything you're soaked to get rid of all your whites it needs to be in terms of V and X when you're done so that's the way the embedded derivative works it says call this piece of eat that way when I take a derivative of it not only am I going to get the other piece that either Y in this case I'm also going to get dy DX that's why these things have to be multiplied together their derivative has to be multiplied by dy DX because we're gonna be taking a derivative of something with Y and it's gonna be multiplied by dy DX let's go ahead once let's change that whatever we can in this am I gonna change the X well no that wasn't in the derivative but this whole entire piece e d by DX that is now divided DV DX on the right hand side I still have a 2 but e to the Y that's now V and I still have all this stuff yes see it do you see that this embedded derivative thing wraps up all the Y's and something very nice it says I'm wrapping up the piece that's not dy/dx SV that one might I take a derivative of it it's giving me a piece that is a derivative dy/dx all of the plies are nicely wrapped up now we gotta solve it well you know what I hope you're seeing it is it separable does it look like it is it linear yeah you have V to the first power that's the only instance of V let's distribute the two let's get the V and on the same side as DV DX let's divide by X and see what happens maybe you can try right now let's distribute that looks a little bit better it says oh hey there's a bee there's no the bees that's B to the first power it's not Bernoulli there's no other bees can I subtract it to get my dvdx and my my V the first power term on the same side that's pretty close there's one more thing we need to do to make it linear hopefully you're seeing it hopefully you see that we got a divided by X right now we want some hope when you see I'm hoping you see that when you're modifying or changing or manipulate or having one say these differential equations by division you're going to get a domain problem so I've said it in several videos now that this is going to be an issue for us let's define it right now so we're doing with linear put that in your head right now we're dealing with linear and we know that X can't be 0 but we also know that we're gonna be dealing with an integrating factor to solve this so if X can't be 0 great but do you want to deal with absolute values later with linear no because oftentimes we can simplify a lot of X's and the absolute value would hold us back let's just make this greater than Israel that's gonna show up this is not because of this right now it's not a greater than 0 because of this right now it's greater than 0 because of the integrating factor later so we don't have to have the absolute value so keep that in mind how about we go ahead and find that our P of X if this is linear it's gotta have a P of X let's find our integrating factor Rho of X which we know what that is that takes e to the integral of P of X which gives us e to the negative to LNS hey that's pretty cool because we don't have to have this whole absolute value you can simplify very nicely get 1 over x squared let's see what how that happens so we'll move up this made of 2 we know a composition of inverse function simplifies be with Ln we have Rho of X equals 1 over x squared let's multiply by that so that's our integrating factor we're gonna use that to solve our linear differential equation in terms of V and X we know that we're creating this result of a product rule and that's what that missing piece integrating factor does for us in this case so we had let's see we had DV DX minus 2 over x times V equals let's see 2 x squared e to the 2x and we're going to take that Rho of X and multiply every single term because we're multiplying both sides is going to distribute so 1 over x squared and 1 over x squared and again let's make sure we simplify at least the right-hand side if you want to trust your math and just understand that your product from this would be 1 over x squared times B I guess that's fine I'm gonna simplify one more 6 I want to check the work so whatever x squared DV DX nice good minus 2 over X cubed V I'm gonna pause right here I'm just going to make sure is the derivative of this this let's see that would be X to the negative 2 and bring down the negative 2 to subtract 1 that's negative 3 move it back down yes now I know that I have the right integrating factor I know really the result of a product rule now on the right hand side X Squared's are gone and now we're ready to do two things number one we're ready to write this as the prop the product that when we take a derivative with respect to X it gives us back that result and then we're ready to say hey if I take an integral on both sides on the left hand side we just get 1 over x squared times B on the right hand side let's see that's a small a minor you so so you would be 2x the derivative would be 2 DX I'd have to divide by 2 so I'm going to get e to the 2x but the 2 and the dividing by 2 are gone so this 2 its divided out when you have that substitution of do you over - all right well maybe we can solve for V right now so if we multiply both sides by x squared guess I better do right we have our plus C we have either 2h plus C multiply both sides by x squared and there's one more thing we're going to do we use our substitution to get away from wise and into these now we'll use it again to get out of these and back into y so let's look back for it says e to the Y all right so if B is e to the Y that we have maybe I'll rewrite this a little bit x squared e to the 2x plus C if you wanted to solve this for y we do Ln on both sides so if e to the y equals x squared e to the 2x plus C then y equals Ln of x squared e to the 2y a 2x plus C that's about as smooth as we can make it are you seeing it are you getting the point the point of these embedded derivatives is that if one piece is there I take the derivative and it's multiplied by the D by DX I can substitute out both of them they become V's and it's it's kind of cool it saves us a lot of work if you try to make this into other techniques either it's impossible or those other techniques are really difficult I'm going to show you that in the next video we're gonna do five examples just like this of some problems we did in homogeneous and demand and Bernoulli the man this makes him a lot nicer so I just want to show that to you in a separate video we have two more examples now to get our our basis just perfect and then then we'll move on and do a different video all right last to this so I'm gonna do all the way with you maybe you can start right now I'm gonna do all the way with you this one I'm not going to I'm going to show you how to set up this is a little weird and I'm gonna leave you when we get to the the type of differential equation that you can solve on your own so let's start with this one you can look at it can you see a piece that when you take a derivative of it is up there and has dy/dx next to it if you can write out V equals that piece right now so V equals that sine squared why why that one because when we take the derivative of sine squared Y we get to bring them an exponent then B to leave the inside alone sine Y to the first power but derivative of the inside would be cosine Y that's the chain rule again so the derivative of sine squared Y is 2 sine Y cosine life just begin you have to have all of your lies wrapped up in whatever substitution you are making so if this is going to be your V the derivative that better include a dy/dx got a wide it's got everything else that has a Y that's connected to it so it's gotta do that and it does this is alright well hey there's 2 Lykos online here's two semi-crystalline dy/dx it's gonna replace all of that stuff except for the X so all of that is DV DX except DX equals now for we're not worried about the x's 4x squared is fine but we have this sine squared Y is V man it looks a lot nicer here this is like junk but this looks a little less like junk it looks like linear me can we subtract the V can we get the V the first power on the same size DV DX let's do that can we make it into the linear differential equation can we divide everything by X so dividing by X we'll get our DV DX we get our minus 1 over X B we get equals 4x because we divided by a wait a minute we divided by X we divided by X on a linear can't be 0 y greater than 0 for the absolute value let's not have to write that that's why we put that happens on linear a lot let's see if we get the rest of it so it's Linea we know what P of X is P of X has to be this negative 1 over X we know Rho of X then will be e to the e to the integral of P of X all right Rho of X would be e to the negative Ln X we don't worry about absolute value we'd if we restrict our domain to X greater than 0 but we do know that Rho of X could be written as e to the ln x to the negative 1 hey composition inverse functions X to the negative 1 is one of her eggs are you with me are you getting it is a making sense to you where we're getting this stuff it's just linear I know but doing the embedded rid of the substitution wants to see them really well now let's use it so we know that we'll be multiplying every single term by a 1 over X so DV DX minus 1 over x times B is 4x and we'll multiply it by the integrating factor by distribution on every single one of those terms let's simplify let's check our work and then let's integrate so 1 over X DV DX looks really good this gives us minus 1 over x squared let's double-check is the derivative of this people to this yep equals just for later works by making the result of a product rule we now know what the product is that product has to be 1 over x times me and when I take the derivative with respect to X it gives me this therefore the undoing of that says hey this is the result of a derivative the check to X of some sort of product this right the product on the right hand side we get 4 and we know how linear differential equations are solved at this point by using the integrating factor we take the integral of both sides with respect to X left hand side done man I love that technique right inside 4x plus C hmm well because we don't have the absolute value here we're able to multiply by X and start doing things like getting 4x squared we wouldn't be able to do that if we had the absolute value that's one reason why we get rid of it when we restrict our domain with that condition it's important for us to know so V would equal 4x squared plus CX what else we got oh yeah we got to get back to wise so if V equals sine squared wide then sine squared y equals that man I'm not sure if I would even throw any further than that we start taking square roots with plus and minus - would we let's leave it leave it just leave implicit it's crazy to try to solve that need for them than that I hope it's making sense oh it's making sense on why we're using this technique and most importantly how it's working so how was work it's great remember we have some domain restrictions when we're going through this especially relating to linear and homogeneous now if you're wondering well all of these and linear all the last four are they always gonna do that the answer is no so I'm going to start this problem with you I'm going to show you that they don't always end linear it's okay to not get linear differential equations out of doing this embedded derivatives substitution that we're doing so let's check out this last one X plus e to the Y dy DX equals x either negative y -1 and you're looking at it you're going okay that doesn't look like anything I know it's definitely not linear it's not separable it's not a basic integral it doesn't look for newly it doesn't look I'm a genius I can't even make it homogeneous because we have to either why what in the world am I going to do that's a good indication especially the e to the Y there with no otherwise that you're gonna have an embedded derivative and so let's look for it but you look for it you go wait a minute the derivative of this piece is not this and furthermore that's not x dy/dx think of border operations it's added first that's a problem so how do we fix that problem one way to start with fixing this problem is to multiply by by something that's going to simplify and give you a derivative so for instance I want the derivative of some sort of like e to the Y to be connected to this so let's multiply by something that does that and that's nasty let's get rid of it well wait a minute what if I multiply both sides by e to the positive Y we're obviously not multiplying by zero or anything because e to the Y can't be zero it's always positive so that's fine maybe if I rewrite this and write the e to the Y second dydx and take a close look at what's going on the right-hand side so the reason why we thought that this was the do it's not thinking any model it looks close to having a derivative over here but it's not really working because that needs to be positive and I need this piece right here and not connected with addition let's multiply to make that happen when I multiply by e to the Y I made rid of that so X either negative Y times either Y gives me X e to the negative y plus y is zero that's just X minus e to the Y and there it is and then we go oh cool if I take that happen this evening the derivative of this piece I get e to the Y dy DX now you can go ahead and try it why don't you try an illness I'm going through it go ahead and call the piece that's not next to do my DX but has all the other wise in it call that piece of B take the derivative of that piece and you know you might have to guess and check a little bit on some of these ones if it's not apparent I don't think about that for a while before I said oh yeah if I multiply by e to the Y I'm gonna get rid of this I'm gonna get it e to the Y and the derivative would be here next to dy/dx I have to think about that so the derivative of e to the Y is e to the Y but it's a chain rule with respect to X so even the y dydx let's start replacing stuff now we see that this whole piece is DV DX X is X even why is be that's no problem but do you remember me telling you this was like ten minutes ago and I said like 30 times that all of your wives have to be replaced with these what that means is that you can't believe that guy so all of this is DV DX yes and that's X and that's a B but if either the Y is me then that either Y also is V and that saves you a headache because otherwise you have three variables not okay and now we look at it and think well I actually don't have just B to the first power I have a V here and if I were to distribute it would be multiplied by DV DX I have to divide I don't want to be doing that I want to get B to the first power what could I do in this case wait a minute I had another section we had we have homogeneous equations and it looked a lot like this in fact if I start dividing I start dividing by that well it's not linear but if I divide everything by X and I say you know what X can equal zero make sure we know that we're divided by X you obviously cannot let X equal zero okay so if that's the case can we make a substitution that's homogeneous the answers yeah and hopefully you can do that on your own for the rest of the way we'd make up I don't want to but we make it another variable say we we've used up our B's so call it W W equals y over X I started B over ice so used to do that W equals B over X do the exact same thing we did for homogeneous and you can solve it so that's just again one quick example to show you that not all of these things when we do embedded derivatives work out to be linear it certainly is nice what it is but if we can do things like other techniques like homogeneous or some basic integrals that we have so watch out for that I hope it's made sense to you I hope you see the kind of power in this technique the technique works this way one last time through the technique works that if it's not fitting something that's a parent or even if it is and this ways easier if you see a piece term that has Y's in it that when you take a derivative of it gives you the otherwise of x dy/dx and you can replace all of your wise and D by DX in terms of V by taking that substitution that's an embedded derivative and they'll work out to something that you can use hopefully linear or homogeneous or another technique that Tatia but that's pretty cool so we're looking for a piece sum term that when I take a derivative of it it's x dy/dx call this piece of e then you get the derivative and dy/dx replace everything all at once that's nice so hoping make sense on the next video what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you five examples that we've done other ways I'm going to show you that this way could have really shortened them so check that out stick with it for the next video it's kind of it's a good it'll be a good one so I'll see you for that you
