Transcript for: Birth Rates and Death Rates in Differential Equations (Differential Equations 33)
hey and welcome to another video I hope you don't well I'll be ready to get started in some other applications of differential equations towards populations so if you remember from two videos ago I went through and I gave you basically a general explanation all the theory behind population modeling as it relates to birth rates and death rates and we did the whole thing we talked about explosion we talked about extinction we talked about the logistic equation and then I gave you a video with just a couple examples to illustrate just how to set up some basic problems of differential equations that involve populations now in this video we're working our way back to the logistic equation and explosion extinction so the way that this this is structured is we did all the theory and then we do some basic examples now we're going to go a little bit more in depth I'm going to show you how birth rates and death rates play into differential equations because we haven't really done that yet we did the theory behind it but what we haven't done as any hardcore examples about it so we're going to talk about that right now I'm going to give you three examples on how to set up a differential equation when you are given birth rates and death rates because honestly that's the hardest part it's just saying these things up so I'll walk you through what to be looking for how to use your initial conditions how to use a some sort of a change in a population to get another said to solve for your C and to solve for your K or your two concepts that you're gonna have I'm also going to talk about how to how to distinguish between directly proportional and inversely proportional and what that means as far as a fraction or a product is concerned when you're going through birth rates and death rates then I'm gonna go through and just we're gonna solve the differential equation the solving parts are not going to be that bad in the next video we're going to be talking more specifically about the logistic equation and some of these the models involving that and so we'll actually have a video before that we're we're gonna refresh what exactly partial fractions are because when we get to some of these harder examples they involve a lot of partial fractions so next video is going to be about these partial fractions just exploring how that relates to differential equations because frankly we forget this stuff so this is what this video is about like really just talking about birth rates and death rates and how they affect our population model with difference of equations so if you remember from two videos ago we talked about how logically and mathematically how the population changes with respect to time shouldn't be this difference in birth rates and death rates as proportional to a population that's what this means remember beta was our birth rate per population unit per unit of time so like five births per thousand people per year or whatever that is and death rates are the same so we're gonna look at that but what I want you to remember is that when you're going through these if it's not just a straight up the way the population changes is proportional to the population itself if they're giving you birth rates and death rates we always really want to start here so if they're saying the birth rate is this the death rate is this whatever that is even if it's constant you can come back and plug this in so we know the way population changes with respect to time is birth rate minus death rate times population that quantity times population that really should make sense the difference between birth rates and death rates if it's portion of the population shows how the population is changing over time so we're always going to try to come back to here and say what's our birth rate what's our death rate plug it in and we have a usually a fairly basic differential equation that we can solve pretty easily so we're gonna just do three examples I'll model how to do this I'll model exactly what I'm thinking about when I'm going through it and hopefully we'll help you out with some of your your examples that you have to do so a certain population stop sperm in reproducing but it's death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of the population already that's a lot of words there were 900 whatever these things are at the start and of our time period and 441 after six weeks when will there be none no is there going to be none at some point well it should make sense that if something stops reproducing and we're assuming remember under this if it's from two videos ago we're assuming there's no hardcourt immigration or exodus a's so nothing's coming into the population that isn't being born there and nothing's leaving the population isn't dying there so think about like a body of water where they're not stalking it they're not pulling out from it it's just the fish that are reproducing or frogs or everyone's so the population stops reproducing all right but if death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of the population what we want to be looking for because you know that this is our model for all of our population growth sorry rates of change of population with respect to time involving birth rates and death rates we want to look for birth rate and our death rate first and so we're going through this cone okay certain population stops reproducing what's that telling you well if it stops reproducing its birth rate is zero well that's that's nice we can already put a zero right there we're gonna write this stuff down where say all right first birth rate is zero but our death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of the population now how would you how would you know that where's that coming from they would have done some sort of a modeling discovering what the deaths of these this specie was over amount of times okay it's really close to inversely proportional to the square root of ovulation so that will be given to you don't to come up with that but it is something that we can model right now so we figured out our birth rate or birth rate is zero it's stopped reproducing our death rate our Delta is let's see inversely proportional to the square root of the population and I want to talk about inversely versus just straight a proportional if something's proportional or directly proportional it means that you have a product of some sort of variation constant constant variation times whatever variable you have so if we would have read proportional to or directly proportional to that would be a K times something when we read inversely proportional that's going to be a division concept so when we see inversely proportional the first thing I want you think of is direct proportional or just proportional means K times and inverse means K / okay / so what this is is as the population is growing the death rate is declining that's a division concept can you see it that we have a constant divided by some number that's growing if K is a constant of variation it's not changing and this number gets bigger and bigger and bigger our death we should decline decline decline as the proportion at the if the death rate remains inversely proportional to the square root of population well that means that as the population gets bigger our death rates should go down and that's what this is saying to us so again proportional K times inversely proportional K divided by so we know that death rate is K divided by the square root of the population I'm going to tell you it's really easy to do things like this oh yeah the square root obviously it's not a square root but it's really common so make sure that we're reading this take some time and really think about it go back because if you don't have this right the rest of your work is irrelevant so your birth rate zero stop reproducing death rate inversely proportional okay K divided by K what Oh square root of the population so we're gonna say no no no not P squared square root of the population and that right there is going to set up a very nice differential equation for us that's pretty much all you need to get started so we have redness really clearly the first couple sentences are typically going to fill that out for you if you're given birth rates and death rates you go that's how it should look birth rate is ever death rate is whatever we know that proportional is K times in versus K divided by very careful how you're setting that up and then we're gonna substitute now what about the rest of the stuff the rest of the stuff the initial condition and then this amount after certain amount of time the initial condition is going to so make a note of this the initial condition is going to solve for your see your arbitrary constant your see that you get upon integrating the next piece that how much you have after certain amount of time that will solve for your K so putting this whole thing together your population change with respect to time dealing with birth rates and death rates will be modeled on that find your birth rate and your death rate in terms of P or a constant that's fine if it says held constant rate just put a K it's okay plug it in solve your differential equation and then as soon as you integrate as soon as you can agree then use your initial condition to solve for C and then use your later Candace so this population change of the certain mount of time to solve your K and then you can answer any question that you want so we're gonna try that right now so we've looked at we said that's it okay we got our birth rate we've got our death rate per unit of population for union time and now that lets us substitute into here so I'm gonna have this population change with respect to time is the birth rate minus the death rate times the population we just plug this in zero K over square root P times P and we can simplify this this would be negative K square root of P or if you want to want to write it better 0 minus this of course we have a negative K T to the one half would be fine as well that's totally fine it really doesn't matter now what do you see well we see the reason why we practiced about 30 videos of just doing differential equations because this is going to be something that falls into one of those categories this is a separable differential equation so we are gonna group our peas DP on one side and are constants D whatever that other independent variable is in this case T on the other side so k is a constant we're gonna leave negative K where it is that's a constant we said that's a constant of variation and it's going to be found by using our population is varying so let's move our peas DP that'll be P to the negative 1/2 we divide both sides by this P to the one-half we would say that population can't be 0 obviously a population mu 0 that's a really important problem to get it just a singular solution there so wouldn't be very very good and then on the right hand side we'd have our K DT I hope that makes sense I'm going to go fairly quickly through some of these basic integrals that are in solving differential equations techniques like separable equations we've done it just a heck of a lot of times so get your peas DPH your constants DT let's integrate both sides and notice that on the left hand side I'm adding 1/2 dividing by 1/2 that's going to be 2 square root P equals negative KT plus your arbitrary constant now you're kind of want to solve for P and I know that you want to do that right now but I'm going to tell you that when you start solving for P it's a whole lot harder to find your C and your K in general as you keep moving forward so as soon as you can you want to solve for the constant and your K so both of these constants why we couldn't do it here because I think I gave you an example a long time ago a long time ago like last video where you could because they gave you the rate at which the population is changing you're not generally going to be given that so we don't know what that rate is what we do know is we know that our initial population was 900 at time zero and we know that there were 441 after six weeks so that's something that we really should write down and I did all this work first but you you might want to consider write it up here first so on hindsight I would say find your birth rate find your death rate find an initial condition so what happens at time zero when we started this situation this observation there was 900 units of whatever than this this species was and after six weeks never caught on in 41 that's something we might want to write down first now I didn't just to show you that this cannot be used here do not start plugging this junk in please wait until you integrate and get right here so again all the way through that's gonna be your population change with respect to time if you're dealing with birth rates and death rates so when we go through this we read it very carefully find your birth rate and find your death rate then write down your initial condition and how much your population is after cert amount of time that's how the population has buried keep that in mind we use our knowledge of differential equations to plug this in and simplify and solve the differential equation and then right here as soon as you integrate give it a try try solving for your C and then solve for years okay in that order the reason why it's got to be in that order is because your initial condition is you can plug in zero forty and kill off that K which you don't know if you try to solve for K first you'd have too many variables that wouldn't really work that well so plug in your initial condition time of zero and a population and it's going to solve for C very nicely then plug that in turn right back around and use that how your population has buried two so for your constant of variation so let's try it right now so we've done our integration we go came right here don't sell for P that doesn't do everything to solve for C if you did that let's plug in P is zero equals 900 so P of 0 equals nine and I would see mm that means that this is going to change to two times the square root of nine hundred so when T is zero we had nine hundred units of population we don't know what the K is but that's fine that's why we're using the initial condition first at time of zero because that's going to zero times any constant give you zero let's see and if we do all the work on two times 30 is 60 so C is 60 take that constant and use that right now to rewrite this so we know that 2 square root P equals negative KT plus 60 so all we've done is we've done our difference the quiz all tour difference equation and then solve our arbitrary constant like we've done many many many many times with initial conditions that's what your initial condition does it solves for your artery constant then we're gonna turn right back around as soon as we can and solve for that K so we need to find that out as well the constant of variation is typically found how your population is varying after certain amount of time so once we've found our C first zero because it kills off that K I'm going to say all right well at times 6 and we're going to keep in the back of our mind that this means six weeks eight times six we had 441 years of population okay all right so let's see we had 441 units of population after six weeks and because we sold first that's not 60 because we saw for our C we're now it will solve for that K so doing just a little bit of math square root of 441 is 21 I believe so 2 times 21 equals well that's negative 6k plus 60 and that's really easy for us to solve that says let's just multiply it's gonna be 42 we subtract 60 from both sides we get that 18 but it's negative and then k equals positive 3 so k equals positive 3 that means that our debt let's see let's think about that so our death rate was K divided by the square root of P so that means as the populations growing that death rate is declining but it's still positive things are still dying now now we can plug that in and solve for P so we've done everything we found an arbitrary constant it was 60 we found that a constant variation was 3 we should have an idea but what that means and now when we substitute that in we know that 2 square root P equals negative 3t well it's 60 no question question do you understand how the birth rate and death rate was found you understand how the initial condition salts with arbitrary constant should know and how the how the the population varies how we find the constant variation once you've done that these are application problems so these are looking for an answer they're looking for an answer to some question when will the with the wait will there be nine in other words when that's time will the population be zero she can't make sense to you that if the birthrate is zero and the death rate is positive which we see that it is that K is positive and the population is positive so your death rate is positive if your birthrate zero and things are still dying you're eventually going to have nothing so if that birthrate doesn't change and the death rate is held to be what this is your population is going to die out there will be none so when is that gonna happen when's the population zero it's very tempting to solve this for P I know it's really it's really tempting to be like okay I got invited by to square both sides why why do that if we're trying to find out when that's a time now unless it says specifically solved for the population model well you could do that you could divide everything by to square both sides and you find the population based on time but if we are asking this question and other good like this so dividing by two negative three times T plus 30 and then square both sides and you could get the population but model based on time that's that's totally fine if they actually a different question like what's the population after nine weeks or whatever weeks they want good that's that's totally fine but if they're asking when is the population going to be zero well that's a trying to solve for T so we want to solve for T does it benefit us to solve for B not really because we'd have to undo all of that work anyhow so if you want to find out T when the population equals zero that's what we're asking right when does the population zero it's a lot easier to plug in zero here and solve for T then plug in zero here and solve for T because you have to do all the work you did in solvent repeating so I'm gonna do that right here and say all right well that means that if our population is zero supposed to be a zero then we're gonna have negative 3t plus 60 equals zero adding 3 to both sides and / 3 3 20 what's that Dean that means then you think back to what this says with the variation told us here this population vary and so that we went from 900 to 441 in six weeks so that a unit of time for T is given to us in that problem somewhere so that says that according to this modelling the way that this population is changing is that there's going to be none left unless something changes there's going to be none left of 20 weeks I'm trying to make this as streamlined as possible so you understand exactly what you're looking for because word problems we all know this where problems can be a real bear and then mostly it's the setup so when you're dealing with population models I did all the theory two videos ago I did some very basic ones last video where we said okay population the rate of change of population spec time is just proportional to the population somehow now when we start dealing with death rates and birth rates we're going back to a previous video saying all of them should be able to be modeled like this so find your birth rate find your death rate in terms of P or constants then you have a differential equation it's typically okay to solve you solve that differential equation right away use your initial condition to solve for C and if you can use your how the population is buried to solve your constant variation right after that in that work and then we can answer virtually any question they ask us we can solve a population model we can solve for when the population is a certain amount if it's sulfur what population is after certain amount of time hope that makes sense so I'm going to come back to more examples I would say there any more difficult but we're gonna have a different birth rate than zero and see how that works we'll talk about how if you have a birth rate and a death rate that is based on a constant of variation they're not the same constant variation explore that in just a minute let's try another one so we have a certain population and it has a birth rate and a death rate that are both University proportional to population at the beginning when we first started the observation there was 100 units of whatever this specie is bunnies or something and then 169 after six months so it's growing obviously the birth rate should be pacing the death rate how many within one year all right well what do we know we know that because we're given birth rates and death rates the way the population is changing with respect to time the rate of change of population with respect to time should be based on a difference between birth rate and death rate times the population so we discovered that two videos ago now we're just exploring that so let's first look for how about this on purpose because this is the Mobley's kind of lobby's problems let's look for the birth rate so since the birth rate and the death rate are both inversely proportional to the populations and remember what inversely means inversely means K divided by so a constant variation divided by so the birth rate is inversely that's K divided by proportional to the population oh you know what I meant to write a squared popper square root inversely proportional to square root of population then the reason why I wanted that is so I want to I want you to consider the difference we know this problem the last problem less problem birth rate was a constant zero and death rate was proportional to the square root of population now I want to consider what happens if both of these are proportional to the square inversely proportional to the square root of population so last time it was just the death rate that was inversely proportional to the square of population this time it's both birth rate and death rate that are inversely proportional to the square root of the population so sorry about that so the birth rate is inversely proportional that's K divided by the square root of the population all right well that's the square root of P well they're definitely the death rates the same the death rate is inversely proportional K divided by to the square root of the population now if we try to put this in here we know that the way the population changes the specter time is birth rate minus death rate okay we got that we read through this we know that the birth rate and the death rate are both inversely proportional that's K divided by 2 the square root of the population that's divided by the square root of P and we can substitute this in here that would be K over square root P for the birth rate minus K over square root P for the death rate times P go that's 0 and you would be right if they were the same constant of variation go how can they be different well your birth rates and death rates aren't always the same and in fact if our population is growing look at that we had a hundred then we had 169 your birth rate is outstripping your death rate so these case can't be the same otherwise the population wouldn't change we just get 0 and the rate of change your population to be 0 and after 6 months you'd have a hundred after a billion years you have a hundred in one change and so our birth rate and death rates can't be the same as these KS are different so to show that go you know what mrs. K sub 1 this is case of two and that was showing that your birth rates and your death rates don't have to be the same in fact they can't be if our populations so we've gone through we've understood what our birth rates and death rates are we were very careful writing those we've made our substitution we now have a differential equation that we're going to work with in just a minute but before we go any further we're not going to use this information yet but we're gonna write down right now we're gonna write down the initial condition so there were a hundred at time zero and after six months so how our population is buried after six months there were 169 of this particular species we want to write all that down so that we're completely done with this probably should do our math okay so we look at their birth rate death rate gotta substitute it now let's solve our difference in equation before we go any further though write down our initial condition and how our population is very depper certain amount of time we're gonna use this as soon as possible right after we solve our differential equation so what world can we do well because both our birth rates and death rates are based on being inversely proportional to the square root of that population it's given us a common denominator we can combine this so case of 1 minus case of 2 all over square root of population times the population and you can see right now we're gonna do basically the same thing we're gonna simplify this square root population one other thing you're gonna see a lot of is it true that a constant minus a constant gives you a constant is that true yeah and so a lot of times what we're gonna do is we're going to take this different constants of variation and say you know since we're based on the same inversely proportional to the square root of population idea we can define a different K to stand for that constant and that makes our math a little bit more concise it's not going to affect your problem at all while that's gonna do is make it a little bit nicer when you start plugging in numbers your initial condition and then your constant variation information it's going to make it a little more succinct and so let's go ahead and make the same difference in equation with respect to time and we'll have K square root P just like we had before but notice the negative right there you could also could make this just like before this like less example K T times P to the one-half power and now we have something that's separable you really should try this from here on out so get your P's DP your constants DT integrate plug in your initial condition right after you do that to solve your C then plug in your varying puddler the information on how your population is varying to solve for your constant of variation right after that and then we'll see what we'll see what we have after that so peas DP K constant D team if we integrate we get exactly the same thing we did before there's 2 square root P and then on the right hand side let's see we get this KT plus C I want to talk about something real quick before we get I told you that right now we're gonna do it in just a minute I'm just gonna give you a little aside here we're gonna plug in our initial condition or software see there even plug in our varying how our populations vary in software RK but once in a while you're gonna be asked to show something so if you're ever asked to show with the population model is based on an initial condition where the initial condition is changeable you what do you mean what if I didn't tell you there was a hundred items what if I wanted to move this model to different populations or the same species so in other words yeah this population is started with 100 what Evers but what if I wanted to model this on a different population where we knew the same dynamics and that same dynamics were going to happen but that initial condition was like a thousand or 1500 or two and but and we knew the same things was going to happen well then oftentimes what we do as we say if I melt if I don't know an actual initial starting population so the initial population if I don't know that I call it P Sub Zero and then your constant will be based on that piece of zero and so how we would show this you can say all right I plug in 0 for T I plug in P Sub Zero for P so there'd be 2 square root of P sub 0 equals zero plus C and then we can have something that's at least at least we have this arbitrary constant we can write up there so c1 equals 2 squared P Sub Zero we go right if I want to solve this now 2 square root P would equal K times T plus 2 square root of 0 we can solve for that arbitrary constant in terms of an initial population whatever that population happens to be then what we can do after that well we can't really solve for K can't wait because in order to solve for K we need to know an initial population and so what you could do here is just say well if I wanted if I wanted to solve for the population model I divide everything by 2 and square both sides and we can find a model for the population but notice you would need to know some more information before you go any further so we said can you find out a population model yes but to get more specific you need to know about a specific population you would need to know the initial population and you could just strain a plug in it right there that is the initial population so if we move to a different area want to apply this model to a different population we need to know where we start and then we'd also need to know how the population is varying after certain amount of time so initial population we go here what is solve for that k you need to know how the population is varying a little bit after that then we could get more specific but at least we can find a population model right now so could you plug in 100 right here yes could you plug in 640 and then population of 169 and solve for K after you've done that of course it's a lot harder to do from there but if we were going to apply this model to some of the population that's nice to have because we can now plug in different specific starting and changing points in that population and get a working model format I hope that makes sense to you that we can still solve this for P we just have a couple of arbitrary non-arbitrary we have a couple constants in there that would be based on whatever population we're dealing with so can you still solve for P yes and get a model of course this based on initial population uh-huh and somehow it constant variation yeah you can totally do that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna race this I'm gonna come back up here and then we're going to do what this particular problem is calling for we want to find out whatever C is based on this initial condition whatever our K is based on how our population is varying after 6 months so we're going to do an answer this particular collection so right here we'd say Y solve for P if we're dealing with this one population we would say that the population is 100 at a time of 0 and we would get to C is 20 we now know C and because we're solving for K and we were able to plug in 6 for time and 169 for population based on how that's varying let's see 2 times 13 that's 26 6 equals 6 K okay is a very convenient one and now we're looked like that right back in know what I said here that we really are playing it here we found that so one time all the way through we look for birth rate death rate you know too bad that's how our model should be you plug it in we do our substitution we get this difference in equation we know that we have a constant variation that we can combine a couple constants if possible it's not a problem we solve our difference of equation if we need to solve for P I showed you how to do that with an initial population if we don't if we're answering specific questions on a specific population like we are here find your C first within an actual condition find your case second with how the population is varying and then we have this model to square root of the population equals time plus 20 where time is in months and now we answer the question we're gonna say we're gonna see whether it's gonna benefit us to solve for P or not so how many is there going to be in one year how many how many is a population after certain amount of time so would it benefit as a so to solve for P yeah yeah would because we're trying to solve the population anyhow so let's divide everything by 2 and then square both sides so divided by 2 we get T over 2 plus 10 square both sides of 80 over 2 plus 10 quantity squared this is the population based on a given time now we're gonna find the time after 1 so we plug in 1 right it's real careful if this isn't 6 months we're gonna plug in 12 because 12 months is 1 year so the population after 12 months is 12 divided by 2 plus 10 and they squared our population after 12 months 16 so 256 so 256 whatever this species is man I hope that makes sense I hope you've seen the interplay between birth rates and death rates that if you have two different if you have two concentration they are different otherwise your population won't change it generally won't change if your based on the same very same way or varying with the population so could they be different proportionalities yeah they can and would changing those constants are the same but you can't assume that they are the same oh that makes sense you don't just assume there's the same constant variation in this case your population wouldn't change at all and we know that it's growing so that can't that can't work so I hope it makes sense that the integration should be very nice for us right now the separable differential equation should be really really nice and then knowing when to plug in for your constant C and when to plug in for your constant K is crucial so we got one more we're almost done we'll be right back last one for the video so we're dealing with another population I know I've had the same thing three times we're dealing with this a slightly different way I want to show you in this example but because we have proportional where I can have a K divided by K times we'll talk about a doomsday versus extinction here so I want to show you how the K being positive will lead to a doomsday or to a population explosions what we call that or if our K would be negative we deal with an extinction scenario so I'll show you where that comes from so let's explore this let's pay attention to that that last a little bit I'm going to solve for P I'm going to show you the model here the population model based on K and the initial population and then we'll deal with this specific example so certain population has birth rate and death rate that are both proportional to population there are six when we initially saw and nine out of ten months when will the population explosion happen how do I know there's going to be a population explosion well proportional is climbing and climbing and climbing but if our population has grown after an initial condition condition that means our birthrate is outstripping our death rate and it's going to explode at some point based on that portion ality so we're going to see that at play right now so we've read through we're going to go ahead we're going to say all right hey this is dealing birth rates and death rates and a changing population let's try to model with this our birth rate says proportional to population when you proportionately is directly proportional or varies directly means K times so our birth rate is K times population and so is our death rate it says they're both proportional to the population so we're gonna call one case of 1 in 1 case of tooth and now we're ready to go ahead and find our initial condition and how our population is changing after certain amount of time so have we start there was 9 at the initial opposite observations so at times ooh sorry 6 there is 6 whatever these are at the initial observation after 10 months or months here there were 9 certainly doesn't think it seemed like there's gonna be a population explosion right you're like after 10 months alone three of them but it will happen eventually now that we've found our birth rate and our death rate in terms of our population now that we have our initial condition and how our population is varying after a certain amount of time let's substitute this and find a differential equation that models it so we know that our birth rate K sub 1 times population - our death rate case of 2 times population times population might be a real good idea to factor out that P sort of what we did before and we simply simplify it with the P so let's do that let's we factor the P we're going to get it the case of 1 minus K sub 2 times P squared because I'm cancelled get K squared now let's redefine it like we did before in the last example and say that instead of case of 1 minus case of 2 let's call this K and I want to make an important point here based on what those k's are determines whether you are going to have an explosion or an extinction in this particular case if that K is positive you're going to grow and the change in population will be positive and grow grow grow grow grow this can be negative grow without bound it will not be a ballot here you will get a population explosion they call that a doomsday because at some point population is just so massively large there's not enough space or food or whatever for this particular species if that K is negative then this would decline and always decline decline decline decline decline it wouldn't go to zero that would be an extinction event and so we'll see that right now so so wait a minute wait how would the kv+ that K would be positive because these are the same population at the same time that K would be positive if the birth rate is greater than the death rate that's the only way they could happen so the only way that birth rate is different from death right here is if the case are different so the K will be positive if birth rate is greater than death rate K will be negative if birth rate is less than death rate it's only way that's going to happen we're gonna consider both of those in just a minute so hang on to that so we're gonna call this K we're gonna solve our differences equation we're gonna prove our peas DP are constants DT and we're going to integrate so on the left-hand side we're going to add 1 divided by negative 1 so negative 1 over P on the right hand side we're gonna be have a KT plus C again and I'm going to do two things I will be coming back to this and using it but because I want us to explore extinction vs. explosion so explosion versus extinction I want to solve this for P the way it is so I'm going to do a little aside right here we're going to talk all the way through that then we're going to see this actually happen with this information so if we solve that for P the first thing I might want to do if I'm gonna solve that for P man I might just I might just solve for the constant right now this is this this arbitrary constant by saying that at Oh times zero I'm going to have an initial population so you'll notice I do this a lot right I solve for that arbitrary constant C like every time if I can and it's always going to end up being some form of an initial population so I'm going to plug in 0 for T and P Sub Zero for P based on this right here so P Sub Zero 13 at time 0 lets us solve for C we know that C is negative 1 over P sub 0 let's plug that back in right there okay now you know I don't like that negative maybe we change all the sons also I know I'm gonna try to reciprocate this so we have we're going to need to find a common denominator so we're gonna multiply this by P Sub Zero over P Sub Zero these are the same a vision multiply P Sub Zero a piece of 0 now that we have that common denominator we're going to combine that fraction and we've written it all out of order so it's a 1 minus P sub 0 K T all the P sub 0 and if we reciprocate both sides so you think about cross multiply divided if you want to you our population due to time is based on the initial population divided by 1 minus the initial population times K positive variation comparing the birth rates and death rates times T now I need you to see this if your kay is positive notice how your time is always positive in initial population is always positive otherwise this is a meaningless problem and if you Mitchell population is zero then this will be zero because it'd be zero divided by one minus zero you would get no pup you would have no population how could you have a population after a short amount of time if you don't start with the population doesn't make sense so if our K is positive stick with me if our K is positive that means our birth rate is greater than death rate our population should be growing right if our K is positive that means that we have a positive here a positive here and positive here one minus that number is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller while your initial population that number doesn't change that's a constant so remember that was C right they came from C so you have a constant being divided by a denominator it's shrinking you were going to get a population explosion do you see the map the population approaches infinity as T approaches infinity if K is a positive number so that this actually know as T approaches what would that be because we want this to get closer to 1 right so if T is approaching 1 or P sub 0 k if T is approaching this number then look at that if T is 1 over P sub 0 sometimes K this would get closer and closer to 1 to think about it if this is getting closer to 1 divided by P sub 0 K then this is getting closer and closer and closer and closer to 1 then 1 minus of that number is getting closer and closer and closer and closer to 0 then constant over something's get closer closer to 0 is getting really close to positive infinity so K is positive one more time if K is positive it means birth rates are good with death rates that means K is positive that means that this is getting really close to 1 this would get really close to zero this whole fraction close to infinity positive infinity that's a population explosion that T as the time approaches that value one of the pieces times K whatever that happens to be that's when you are gonna get the population explosion and show you that in just a minute promise i'ma show you that's an actual example in just a minute now what if your K were negative told you as we talk about that right now so what if your your death rate is outpacing your birth rate that would mean birth weights listen decorate your cave would be zero if your K is zero here sorry I think I don't mean K is negative if you can see negative that's a positive and a positive and a negative number one minus a negative is a positive this would be growing and growing and growing and growing and that's T approached infinity after a long time love whatever that is as T approaches infinity this number we need to getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger this number was say the same your population would go to zero are you seeing it so if your K is positive then as T approaches one of the piece of zero K your population is exploding but if K is negative then as T approaches infinity K is negative you're subtracting and negative if that can't change and that can't change and that's the only thing that's changing then as T approaches infinity this approaches infinity your fraction approaches constant over and affinity constant over something approach infinity would give you something very close to zero your population quote zero this is the difference between an explosion and an extinction it's all based on your K in this case so this says yeah your birth room mam's gotta make sense I mean are you seeing a sync if your birth rates are bigger than your death rates you're gonna grow obviously you're gonna grow how much you're gonna grow it's based on whether you're bound it or not logistic or not you're not bounded by anything you're saying that this shows you you're not bounded this says that if as your K is positive and your T is approaching 1 over P sub 0 K you're getting really close to 0 here when you're getting close to zero your constant divided by something close as your as exploding if your case negative so you're perfect you're less than your death rates well that's a negative number and as T approaches infinity you're saying 1 plus some number that's going to infinity a constant divided by 1 lose some number going to infinity it's going to go to 0 you're gonna get extinction I hope you're seeing that I hope you're seeing the infinitely became like a calculus one idea like going to different infinities as your T approaches different numbers based on a constant that's positive or negative that's a count one idea but it's so interesting to see this of populations is really interesting to see why we get population explosions and why we get population extinctions mathematically logically it makes sense birth rates are grim and death rates for richer listen that rates make sense but seeing that mathematically with your with your limits is pretty neat and that's exactly what we're doing so I'm gonna erase this real quick and what I'm gonna do is we're gonna now use this information and I'm gonna show you why that works I'm gonna show you what this does so coming back up here and saying hey you know what now that we have this negative 1 over P equals K T let's see and say hey how do I solve for C my initial condition would be data so the population is 6 when my time is 0 C is negative 1/6 wait a minute C is negative 1 over the initial population yes it is ok so negative 1 over P equals K times T a minus 1/6 we can now use how the populations vary and to find our constant variation so when the population has had 10 months to grow we have 9 you know let's go ahead and add 1/6 right now so let's see negative 1/9 plus 1/6 negative to 18 plus 3 should be 118 and if we divide by 10 K equals 1 over 180 wait a minute didn't we say the K should be positive here yes in fact we did we said that because our population is growing it shouldn't make sense that the birthrate has outpaced the death rate so the difference between those two needs to be a positive number and in fact that's what we have here so we know we know right now based on what we just learned about this that if our K is positive we are going to get an explosion we're all being able to answer this question we are going to get explosion we just talked about why big versus the limits we talked about however we're doing taking a constant a constant they're both positive and the teasing closer to 1 over that number you're subtracting 1 minus something close to 1 you're going to get something close to zero you're going to get a positive explosion that's gonna go to infinity this shows that our K is positive now let's let's rewrite that so we're gonna put this right here like before just like we do over there let's change all our signs so change a sign positive change the sign positive change sign - I've made this T over 180 let's get a common denominator so let's see that would be multiplied by 30 if we make one fraction there we're going to get this one over P equals 30 minus T over way reciprocate and we have a specific function that models this specific population now use your calculus 1 prints think about this for a second as T gets closer to what number will this population go bananas as T gets closer to look you're subtracting so 30 minus let's say 0 30 minus 0 you should get 630 - let's say ten thirty minus 10 would give you twenty one 80/20 would give you no my guess it works now what if we did 30 minus like hello 30 miles 29 30 minus 29 would give you 180 over 30 minus 29 wouldn't give you 32 by 180 divided by one that give you a 180 whatever the species is after 29 years 29 sorry 29 months two months what about twenty nine point nine months so 29 month and twenty nine twenty ninth month is pretty important so twenty nine months we're a hundred eighty whatever these are @ 29.9 you have now 180 divided by point one that's 1800 what about twenty nine point nine nine point zero one that's now 18,000 so as T approaches what month what number what month is this exploding like crazy well as T approaches 30 right here this is a positive number as T is climbing it's going to be a closer and closer and closer and closer and closer to 30 it's gonna closer to that well as it's getting closer to 30 as time goes on time starts at 0 goes positive then this is going to start exploding until we hit 30 and then we get an infinity and undefined idea we can't get past that so right here as T approaches 30 our population is approaching infinity now I told you that was gonna I was gonna make sense ago uh can't even think about that what is 1 over P sub 0 K P sub 0 was 6 K was 1 over 108 P sub 0 is 6 K is 1 over 180 if you do that let's see 1 it's multiplying but listen let's just so that's a complex fraction so T would be 180 over 6 T would be 30 as T approaches 30 the fat is going to go to infinity we showed it we just showed it right here and now we see that we see it in the math we see it as a formula if you wanna call that formula but I want you to logically understand what we talked about I want to understand that if your K is positive your T goes to infinity you're gonna explosion with these cases if your K is negative or any an extinction so if this was like a 6 and this was like a 3 your K would be negative right here you would see that as T approaches infinity you're gonna go to 0 you can try that for yourself man that's that's kind of cool if you want to see the exact model of that if you wants it doesn't look you take the same Leonard let me get the same thing by doing this if you divide everything by 30 then we incentivize one over 30 30 and then you can read that so that would be six over one minus one thirtieth teen as T approaches 30 as T approaches 31 over 30 times something approaching one over 30 is getting really close to one well I'm finding something really close to one it's getting close to 0-6 to buy this buy something really close to zero is getting really close to infinity try the other one for yourself dude do one where you're your population is decreasing like like like this call that three and see what happens see what would happen just for fun you 1/3 right there one-third plus one-sixth some negative one-third plus one-sixth negative two sixths plus one six is negative 1 6 multiplied by 10 giving cave equals negative one over 60 right there we see the negative K we know what's going to happen we're going to the extinction of bed this would be so it's still positive one six but we would get a positive T over 60 then this would give us a 10 plus T over 60 getting a common denominator 10 over 60 so 10 plus T over 60 when we reciprocate that would go straight up right there let's see if that works yeah we divided by 10 no this this model so if you want to do that you can divide everything by 10 gets 6 equals 1 plus T orbital and I would say your initial population 6 1 what apply plans that why is it plus there'd be - nope is your case negative that change that I'm gonna go back up to here because it's easier to remember right right now so Jake take a look man this is you icing on the cake pretty cool what's happening there what's happening your initial population starts at 6 well I can change the system to see the 6 that sounded not a big deal we're looking at it as your key it's bigger and bigger and bigger what's happening to this fraction well that's staying the same this says I'm not subtracting anything as T moves for T of 1 well you would let's pretend that T of 10 maybe T of 0 would give me 60 of 10 would give you 360 divided by 20 is 3 how about four how about sorry I would 11 how about 12 about 1300 1400 15 how about infinity as T gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger we're dividing 60 by something that's growing positively larger and larger and larger you have a constant over something going to that's gonna go to zero and now we've explained this both of these ideas with actual numbers I hope that makes sense I hope you're seeing the interplay between the limits of like calculus one these populations and these differential equations this is awesome this is really cool so I hope you've enjoyed it I hope I've made some of these population models understandable for you as they relate to birth rates and death rates I'm gonna see you for the next video where we're just going to talk about partial fractions because in the next video after that we deal with a lot of them so get prepared for it if you don't need help on partial fractions feel free to skip it but I will show you how they relate to differential equations so I'll see you for the next video on that you
