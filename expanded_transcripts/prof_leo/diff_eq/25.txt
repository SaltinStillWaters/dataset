Transcript for: How Embedded Derivatives Can Make Differential Equations Easier (Differential Equations 25)
hey there I mentioned in the last video that we're going to take a look at five examples in this video that we can do with an embedded derivative that we've done before as either homogeneous or up a newly equation and we're going to take a look at five of those examples the first four of which we've done is homogeneous and we're gonna see that embedded derivatives can sometimes make these a lot more streamlined because we don't have to set up the problem as much so I'm going to show you that with four or five examples for which are homogeneous one for Bernoulli and see that sometimes this is this can be a lot more streamlined a lot easier it's one of the techniques I look for right off the bat when I see the virtual equation is hey do you have a piece of it that's a derivative of a function of Y and so that that's the whole idea if you don't remember from the last video what we're looking for here is a matter of substitution that you can call a function of y equal to B and then the derivative of that function wide width dy DX is on the other side typically or somewhere else in your differential equation and then we can make a nice substitution saves a lot of energy so I'm gonna show you that does it work all the time no but when it does work man sometimes it's nice and so if you want to go back and compare these these four examples with the homogeneous then I'm talking about and alas one Bernoulli you're gonna see that it's a lot easier so here's what we're doing we're looking for a function of Y like Y squared that when you take a derivative of it you get another function or a piece of the differential equation that's up there and this is our substitution so when we look at this we go is there is there a piece of this they can take it to Rivet above that's also in my differential equation well well there is now I want to now one of us just say something here just just like we did with those u subs integration we're not super concerned about matching up our constant coefficients this coefficients this one happens to but you don't need that to happen so just like it you said we're really just looking at do the variables match up and do we get a dy/dx so if you remember all of these substitution techniques every instance of Y has to get wrapped up in a V so in this case we're going to wrap up a function of y sv the derivative function of Y with dy/dx has to be somewhere else in your differential equation let's take a look at it so if you're looking to go okay is there a function of Y that I can call B yeah yeah 2y squared okay is the derivative of that in there somewhere well drew the 2y squared is 4 why could I work with that yeah but could I just take Y squared equals B instead of that - you can do that you don't need to include those constants all in the time and so if we say let's let's just do the equals y squared notice how the entire function all the Y's on the right hand side are gonna be wrapped up into B you have to had to have them for a substitution we can't have three different variables and a difference of the collegiate and work with it with these techniques so we can't say okay well we're gonna just wrap up some of the Y's as bees and then we'll have our X's and we'll have some so B's and y's and x's that that doesn't work so well so every instance of Y has to somehow work in the substitution is being involved in a V so somehow so let's call V equals y squared all right well now well we're gonna have to get rid of that dy DX and then first that we're gonna take a derivative so we're gonna have a DV DX no problem remember that V is a dependent variable and Y is the dependent variable and X is our independent variable so we're taking a derivative on both sides with respect to our independent variable so DV DX but on the right hand side what that means that we're gonna have a chain rule yeah we're gonna get 2y look because Y is it function of X you have a dy/dx that you're gonna have to put up there and that's exactly how embed derivative works so take a look at it go oh hey look if I call this Y squared V so I'm gonna get to V and the left hand side I have a to Y and dy DX the 2 and the y and the dy/dx are gonna get wrapped up in DV DX yes we're still going to have an X that's okay we just need two variables one independent so in the x's and one dependent either why servyse but if you're gonna change some wise we can change all the Y's in this case they does it for so I'm gonna rewrite it just a little bit and then we're gonna make our substitution these I'm gonna try to go a little quicker on these examples because we have the technique I'm just showing you that this can work another way besides homogeneous or Bernoulli equation or one of the techniques that we've done if you remember with homogeneous what we would have had to have done is divide both sides by 2 XY we've got a fraction of X over Y so we had to reciprocate that change the exponent V to the negative 1 power and then we got Y over X that would be V to the first power and then we have to go through deal with that this is much nicer for seeing that so I'm gonna write this as x times 2 dy DX no problem on the right hand side x squared plus 2y squared and now we can see our substitution every instance that's why is going to get wrapped up in some form of V so x squared and leave it the - hey that's not part of your V you need the 2 but Y squared we replace with V on the left hand side we still have the X but 2 y + u my DX the to the Y the new Y DX this whole thing here that's DV DX and you go love it that doesn't look all that great to me can we can we work with it well of course we can work with it let's go ahead and see what what's really going on here do we have X's and V's and nowise yeah do we have a DV DX and V to the first power yeah where it's add or subtracted oh yeah hey that looks a whole lot like something that's linear so let's go ahead let's write this as linear so I'm going to subtract our to the humble size to get something a linear format we're gonna have to get dpdx all by itself so we're gonna have to divide by X and when we do that we're gonna have a domain issue we talked about it now several times let's write that as we go so if X does not equal zero that we get DVD X minus 2 over x times B equals just X we divided everything by X that's looking pretty good now we can go ahead and find an integrating factor now we can multiply everything by it and then we'll be fine so let's find our row of X e to the negative let's just pull that two out tooth negative 2 integral water right well let's see that's negative 2 Ln absolute value of X could I have made this greater than 0 and not how to deal with the absolute value I could have but we're going to get a 1 over X later and so I'm not going to do that because that absolute value needs to be inside of an Ln and so I'm going to put as a few domain restrictions as possible but we are going to notice that that absolute value is going to disappear because we have it to a power 2 so we have this as if we take that negative and apply that that's gonna be one over absolute value of X but then atleast square everything when you square the absolute value it's insane you're gonna get something positive in that or what because of that X so that's gonna disappear that absolute value anyway so we're going to get this 1 over x squared e to the ln gone composition inverse functions you got it we're just getting 1 or x squared let's multiply that everywhere let's see what happens so from here we know that we had a DV DX we know we have a minus 2 over x times V and then we have this X and to multiply that integrating factor of Rho of X on both sides it's going to distribute we're gonna get 1 over x squared looking good and what a r x squared no problem and 1 over x squared and let's simplify what we have this would be this 1 over x squared DV DX minus 2 over X cubed times B equals 1 of X and we're gonna get another absolute value of x so could we define this as greater than 0 yep you could but we're trying to put a few domain restrictions as possible and simplify as much as we can since we wouldn't be able to simplify with this you know see it in a minute I'm gonna leave it just X is not equal to 0 okay let's check our work as the derivative of this equal to this it is it's looking looking awesome now we know it one ear then the left hand side is the result of a product rule of 1 over x squared times a teen on the right hand side we still have 1 over X let's do an integral on both sides with respect to our independent variable X on the left hand side we get 1 over x squared on the right hand side we get Ln absolute value of x yes we need it plus C we're almost done whenever we do this we've got to replace it V at the very end with whatever function of Y we use so in our better derivatives V is always a function of Y that doesn't include X's so that we can that's not true I'm sorry it's usually a function of Y that that doesn't include X's we will see on last example we can't alter that but what we're trying to do here is replace that V with whatever function we we used we got rid of them so in our case we got rid of Y square root of the V let's solve for V first and then we're gonna have to replace that V with that Y squared so multiplying both sides by x squared we get that x squared and then times Ln absolute value of X plus C I mentioned something just a minute ago I said that because we're not going to be able to simplify our expert the absolute value of x we really didn't need the domain restriction of X greater than zero so if you had to get rid of that absolute value we'd have done that we don't really have to do that so we're gonna leave it and then our last step because we used our substitution to get away from Y squared into V now we're gonna use it to get away from feet back into y squared that is about as good as we can make it so again is it necessary all the time use one particular technique for everything a problem that you get and the answer's no it's not sometimes we can have them sometimes a different technique will give us an easier way to get exactly the same answer same answer but we avoided all the homogeneous set up so we didn't need to divide by 2 X Y we didn't need to define some of those things the same way and we still get the same thing so just a quick look at that make sure that when we're doing this that the key points here are that you have to wrap up every instance of Y in some form of be either V itself Y squared becomes V or DV DX so the derivative of your function of y equals whatever derivative you have on the left hand side connected to a dy/dx then we substitute Y squared equals V great the derivative equals DV DX and typically works out very very nicely let's take a look at another exam and then we'll come back with with two more in there last one which is really interesting you gotta hang out the last one so next up okay we see this so could we do a homogeneous yes yeah we could divide everything by X Y squared is actually not all that bad what's gonna happen is we're gonna looks like we have beaten a of two maybe I'm not sure well we divide everything by this and then we have to go through do homogeneous create a separable equation not really a huge issue but can't we do it differently with an embedded derivative well let's take a look do you see a function that if you take a derivative of it you are going to get something on the left hand side typically the left hand side so in other words do you see a function of Y that when we take a derivative of it the derivative is there with a dy/dx next to it yeah I see that if I called the Y cubed and I take the derivative of it both sides DV DX three Y squared dy DX implicit derivative we get chain rules make it wait a minute no that's not the same that this one that says three that says no three one really does look just like we did with au so on integrals man just just solve for the piece you want to replace so if DV DX equals 3y squared dy DX but you don't want the three let's just divide both sides by three then we have one-third DV DX equals y squared dy DX that way we can replace all of the y squared dy DX we'll leave the X we'll replace all of the Y squared dy DX with this one-third DV DX is that makes sense I hope that makes sense in your head that you're going oh yeah okay it's just like it used up it's basically the same thing we're just doing sort of a double substitution we're calling the function of y equal to a B then the derivative that's going to yield a DV DX replace the function with of Y the derivative of function with Y with du by DX with whatever that equals so let's solve for what we want to place and that's the idea or replacing this with me the derivative is 3 y squared dy DX we only really want to replace y squared dy DX so solve for that piece in your derivative and then we can replace this whole thing with 1/3 DV DX let's do that now so maybe she try to your own so if we go ahead and replace that we'll get on the left hand side we still have an X but that y squared dy DX this piece is 1/3 DV DX on the right hand side we still have X cube no problem but we don't have Y cubed anymore we call that V and this isn't exactly what we need to happen all of our wives are gone we replace the Y function with the limit dy DX with the derivative of that function should be some matter of DV DX in this case we had a 1/3 sure because we did not have a 3 there that's exactly what we were looking for after that man this this still looks linear we have a DV DX so we have something that's adding to the first power in terms of our dependent variable let's make this x over 3 minus B equals x cubed hopefully you're seeing the linear a little bit easier these points man but linear means that we have DV DX by itself then adders are attracted to a function of X V to the first we're pretty close let's multiply everything by the reciprocal of x over 3 so 3 over X so when we do that when we do that we need to write our domain restriction we know that X can't be 0 but because I'm gonna get a linear and because I'm not gonna get an L n over here notice that we get x squared because of that I'm gonna say that let's just make X greater than 0 that way we don't do with those absolute values don't run into any other domain issues so we're gonna do this we're gonna get this DVD X minus 3 over x times V and then we get this 3x squared that's looking pretty nice so far can you do the rest can you find our integrating factor can you multiply everything by it can you do the result of a product rule and take an integral I bet you can we should try it so for us integrating factor with it is e to the negative 3 integral of 1 over X DX well that's equal to e to the negative 3 Ln X is greater than 0 we don't need an absolute value that's e to the Ln X to the negative third power removing that coefficient is an exponent inverse functions are composed we just get 1 over X cubed let's multiply everything here in this nice form of a linear by 1 over X cubed if we do that well we still have DV DX we still have the 3 over x times V we said 3 x squared but now we're gonna multiply the 1 over X cubed so multiply both sides every terms going to get in [Applause] Oh hands wrong they're gonna get absolute Betty vex good thing I had that greater than zero nothing start out maybe simplifying probably tell em no okay so on the left-hand side this is the result of a product rule we can go straight for that derivative with respect to X of whatever the product of the functions you wouldn't have taken the derivative out so that's 1 over X cubed times V on the right hand side we get 3 over X ok let's take an integral of both sides and respect to X so left hand side integral of a derivative give us 1 over X cubed times V on the right hand side we're gonna have 3 ln no absolute value of x because again we define our domain that way we are going to get a plus C however man we're almost done there's only two things that we need to do let's solve for V as much as possible and then we'll replace V with the function that we replaced so we use the V to replace a function we're going to use the function to replace to be solve for V first though could you take the three and make it Ln of X cubed yeah you certainly could does it does it matter debate depends not really the only thing that we got to be concerned about is that what we're gonna do here well I think I pointed the wrong thing we what we get into here is we have to replace the function the V with the function y that we use them initially so we replaced Y cubed with me we're gonna now replace V with Y cubed and whether you want to write the X cubed first or last it doesn't really matter that's the idea we're looking for a function of Y that when you take a derivative of it you also have the variables and dy/dx in there and that's exactly we've done B is Y cubed great we've got a 3y squared dy DX no we just need Y's for dy/dx that gives us something a little bit different to substitute but it's just that constant coefficient it's not a big deal so we we don't lose it and it's gonna affect this of course but it's not gonna ruin this sort of technique for us so nice thing it comes up with a linear we may get a domain restriction and it works out really nicely so I hope it's making sense to you I'm gonna come back with two more examples let's try a couple more so take a look at our differential equation homogeneous yep you could write it as homogeneous do we have to know let's look for an embedded derivative see that this can be a little bit nicer for us so instead of dividing by x and y go ahead and writing well probably be to the negative one again and then B itself and doing all that stuff maybe with common denominators not super fun let's go ahead and find a vendor it embedded derivative what we're looking for is just just like au so this is a forward integration so we're looking for a function of Y like Y squared that the derivative matches up disregarding our constants so if we take our V equals y squared and we take a derivative of that with respect to X since Y is a function of X we have an implicit there we got that chain rule dy/dx and then we say well yeah you know what hey the derivative of Y squared is 2 is 2y but it is why do you ID X let's solve for that substitution let's solve for y D by DX so 1/2 DV DX equals y dy DX and now we're ready to make this this double substitution one for the function of Y one for the dy/dx with a derivative of function y attached to it and that's going to replace every instance of Y that's exactly what we want so we're gonna leave our X but we're gonna get Y dy DX is one-half DV DX on the right hand side we get x squared plus we did replace the 3 we replace just the y squared now it's still linear so we have a DV DX we have V the first power to no other cases of V it's added to that x squared so let's go ahead let's write this in linear format pretty close but we know that with Lennie we want that DV DX by itself we want the D dependent variable over independent variable without anything connected to it being multiplied so we're gonna have to multiply by 2 over X now when we do that we're gonna have a domain restriction because we're multiplying by something where X can't be 0 so I'm not gonna show here but we're multiplying everything by 2 over X this whole entire piece so that gives us DV DX minus 6 over x times V and then 2 X and we know X can be 0 in order for us to make this technique work and that's the domain restrictions we have to show that otherwise we get stuck how we do it you gotta find that X ray yeah okay make sure it's on 0 so let's do that we multiplied by two over X or multiplied by 2 divided by X DV DX looks good let me get this minus 6 over X V great that's linear and we get this 2x not a problem now let's find our integrating this factor by taking a look at our thumb to the becks in front of our B to the first power if you're wondering why I didn't do X greater than 0 that's in your mind right now it's linear once you do agreed and 0 I didn't do in the first one either because I saw that that's a power 6 no matter what that's gonna be positive so it doesn't really matter let's see so this would be X to the negative sixth power well if we think about that that's gonna be one over absolutely of X but then to the sixth power we would get composition inverse functions no problem this is going to be 1 over X to the sixth that's an integrating factor that we're gonna use for this example let's multiply everything by that so we started with a DV DX we have also this minus 6 over x times B on the right hand side we get 2x so let's multiply everything by 1 over X to the sixth if we simplify just a bit it's pretty easy to see that we have the result of our product rule that's kind of nice because that means that our that means that our integrating factor worked for us as far as this linear we could double check it really quickly to see this is X is negative 6 we bring down the 6 subtract 1 negative 7 put it back that's the derivative of this piece which means that this is the resulting apart from let's just write the product on the right hand side we get two over X to the fifth and we are ready we're ready taking the integral this looks great the integral of derivative dawn we get 1 over X to the sixth times V on the right hand side we'll rewrite that just a little bit but pretty easy to integrate so let's take that integral right now with respect to X so left hand side integral derivative we get 1 over X to the 6 times B on the right hand side let's make this the integral of 2 X to the negative fifth power DX and that way when we integrate it's a little bit nice a little bit nicer to see that so let's see we're gonna add 1 so adding 1 that's gonna be negative 4 divided by a new exponent plus C just simplify a bit it's like negative 1/2 or yeah looks about right so 2 4 negative 1 over 2 X to the 4th get a plus C C went down what else has to happen well we still have a V we're gonna have to replace that but I always like solving for V as much as possible before I do if I can so I'm gonna multiply everything times X to the 6th power see if we get that so multiplying by X to the 6 that would be negative x squared over 2 or negative 1/2 x squared then we have C X to the 6th that's lookin fine to you that's the last thing hey we used lead to replace a function of Y let's just replace V with that function of Y so that as good as we can make it one thing we could see you might see a couple different different instances here you could see is someone because we don't really want to solve that explicit for y we disrupt dealing with plus or minus square roots nasty stuff so what we could do instead is multiply everything by two so we multiply everything by two we could get and if you call this C sub 1 then that to C sub 1 we can just rewrite that as C and so 1 if your nutrients are looking different they're probably just messing around like this that looks a little bit nicer so multiplying by 2 we get the 2's squared we saw the negative x squared and a 2 C sub 1 call that C sub 1 C and then we have C X and 6 minus x squared and that's how this this could look so just let me know that's possible hope it's making sense hopefully you understand that we're looking for embedded derivative still I'm just showing you that these can be easier than homogeneous let's do two more I'm gonna start showing you at a slightly different technique so far all of our event derivatives they've had to be just a V equals a function of Y and that is fine but it doesn't have to be that way so I'm gonna show you in this one mm-hm this is gonna make this problem so much easier than we had in homogeneous so if you think about this as far as homogeneous if you learn right that homogeneous Wow you'd have to sum you'd have to subtract your X you'd have to divide everything by Y you'd have an x over Y are you seeing it you'd have to reciprocate that with a negative exponent and then you have this divided by Y you'd have to put a domain restriction of Y so you use a square root Y squared put that in there have another V to a negative power and be the first power and it's pretty darn nasty we spent a long time doing that with a homogeneous equation they used that homogeneous substitution that was nasty let's see if this is easier now I want you to I want to notice something this is a lot of people would fall into this you know we'll wait the derivative of this is 2y dy/dx couldn't I just do that and say here's ye y DX I don't know if you could is there a better way yes sometimes what we can do is we can wrap up everything here with a derivative of something involving exes so I'm gonna rewrite this just slightly I don't look at that and go how do you know what that looks like a derivative of x and y wait a minute I have a mixin Y right there why don't we turn this whole piece and call that V can you use a V with an event derivative that includes exes yes it doesn't happen very often most times it's just white but yeah I can let's call this whole thing V unless you see what happens why why I think well that why why I'm thinking about that is because even if I call this piece of e it's still gonna be nasty cuz I'm gonna the square root of an x squared plus V what do I do with that I don't know I don't know that's really nasty so what if we can call this whole thing V and then get away with doing a derivative of it and replacing the full left side that's gonna be sweet so let's try it so V is the whole inside piece this composition idea remember that how we had it's obvious substitution so it's not that obvious but we're trying to make this embedded derivative work for us and sort of an obvious substitution way let's call this whole thing V let's take a derivative well no wait a second a derivative respect to X so DV DX no problem x squared derivative of x squared with respect to X is just 2x the derivative of Y squared with respect to X it's to Y but then we get a dy/dx that doesn't look the same as that site no it does it but just like before we don't care about our constants let's solve for the piece that we want to get rid of let's solve for the piece that we can sell so if we take this a bill that's justify to wait a minute so if we factor out a 2 oh that is sweet if we factor out a 2 maybe / - this is up so not only have we replaced the inside with the V that's gonna be really nice there's the square root of V easy on the left hand side we now take a derivative of V and DV DX we get 2x plus 2y dy DX er said would wait wait just to bite man if you factor out a 2 then we can replace x + y dy DX in this entire side with just 1/2 DV DX let's do that double substitution now so left hand side x + y dy DX that's equal to 1/2 DV DX that's great every instance of Y on the left hand side is gone it's wrapped up enough DV DX on the right hand side we'd have square root of B Wow wait a minute that's it that's it that's ripped that's a man that's separable right there that we don't have Lennie around nothing as far as is being a hard sort of an integral let's move let's move our these TVs are constants DX so we have 1 over square root V DV equals to V DX let's integrate both sides with respect to X well that's going to be an integral of V to the negative 1/2 power DV on the right hand side you get just 2x plus c left hand side let's finish that integral off let's see we add one that'd be V to the 1/2 divided by a new exponent something divided by 1/2 means multiplying by 2 so this would be 2 square root B equals 2x plus C you know what I might do I might just call this C sub 1 and C sub 1 and C sub 1 that way you can divide by 2 I still wrap that up as a constant but I get rid of that too let's do that now so dividing everything by 2 let's call that C sub 1 over 2 just arbitrary constant are we done do we need anything else let's see we have replaced every part every piece every term every factor everything that involved wise with a V we use that substitution create something with a dy/dx in it that was a derivative of the piece that we chose for me that was replaced with DV DX one half yes because we don't care about constants that led us to just this really nice separable equation that we do an integral we do an integral we solve it as much as we can for V we don't want to start I don't want start squaring things right now what I want to do instead is wait if V is x squared plus y squared let's just replace that so the square root of x squared plus y squared equals x plus C done that's as that's as much as I want out of that if you look back at these at the same example when we did it homogeneous it was at least three times the work so doing better derivatives work every time no they don't but when you do work typically work really nice do you have to only have V equals a function of Y no that happens most of the time when you get these examples but it doesn't happen have to happen all of the time in fact if you combine what we think about an obvious substitution with this idea of an embedded it works really nice so try that try and see if you can wrap up something bigger and then the derivative is also there if it is great if not then you have to make something smaller we're going to try one more example mum show you something that's slightly different than this so this is a great example to see at hope see it's really neat then you can wrap this whole thing up as a B and the derivative still there this works occasionally the next one is a little bit more advanced of an idea we're gonna deal with that one there's one problem took a long time to look really weird and I'm gonna show you how to deal with it with this embedded derivatives so hang on for that one all right let's try one more on this gorgeous little thing you might remember it because it looks so nasty really yeah yeah because I need to show you one more thing that we can do so when we're taking a look at this through the lens of an embedded derivative and you don't want to do a homogeneous or Bernoulli and that's what we did the first time we did this with the Bernoulli equation so that would be in that video we back at Bernoulli equation look it I think it's like the last one or something that is just ugly how in the world is that Bernoulli well if you divide this and you move your Y to the negative two Y of Y you have a wide Omega - that's a written equation and you can solve it that way can we make it easier yes but it takes a little looking at because right now I don't see anything that I can take a derivative of that has a function of Y in it if it matches up with our dy/dx that doesn't I don't see anything there so this is one of the cases where we can kind of outsmart this problem you know well I can't find any V substitution it's obvious I can't find a V substitution that makes this a derivative work for me so maybe I look at the derivative Department ok well let's think about this let's look at X dy/dx plus V you know that looks like the result of a product rule right there doesn't it yeah well wait a minute wait if I if I had if this was the result of a product rule X would be part of the product through X is 1 through wise do my DX Y would be part of the so this comes from the result of a product rule of Y times X notice that derivative leave the Y alone dy/dx derivative Y is 1 and then you have a y let's call this piece V and let's just see what happens so if that piece is V then obviously the derivative of V with respect to X is going to give us exactly this piece you know yeah absolutely because we'd say X dy/dx plus derivative of X is 1 times y so that lets us go ok ok I'm gonna be been able to replace this whole piece with DV DX does that make sense to you are you getting that this piece is DV DX will wait that doesn't help me with my Y's well it sure does because if V involves Y isn't here involves X is also that's ok remember embedded derivatives cannibal X is most of the time don't but they can't involve X's so if this is your function or sorry if this is your dream of DV DX and it doesn't help you with lies well your involves wise can't you just solve for y as long as X does not equal 0 should be able to do that let's go ahead and make our substitution so we remember I'm gonna do it two different parts I'm gonna replace it this which is DV DX I'm gonna leave all this alone X is fine X is our independent variable that's ok so this piece becomes DV DX we have a 1 plus X to the fourth 1/2 power equals x and we have a y squared right now so I want to take a look to make sure this works for you what's there an obvious sort of a choice for V whose derivative is also up there no there wasn't so we thought backwards look at the dy/dx can you choose a V who when you take a derivative of it gives you that piece well yeah in fact this is the result of a product rule x times y ok are those always easy to see no they're not this one was but they're not always that easy so if I take a derivative yeah DVD X and then we owe my gosh should get the exact same piece this whole piece gets replaced with DV DX I still have a y squared I'm about to replace it I still have all this message ugh now about the Y's I mention it but I want to make sure it sinks in if you have a V equals some function of x and y solve for that y and you can replace the Y's it's sort of thinking backwards and before in all the other examples you see the choice of V equals y first and then you go ahead and find your derivative here we use the derivative to pick our choice for x and y and then made the wife fit and that's what we're doing here so this led to this leads to solve for y oh now I can replace my Y with y over X sorry we've done with V over X so y squared no no no let's do V over x squared and then we have a DV DX and we still have all this nasty stuff what's that look like does it look linear to you does it look like you have a term that's added that has C to the first power no it doesn't in fact is everything multiplied and divided yeah this needs to be a separable equation for us so what we're going to look at is that's V squared multiplied by DV DX that's crazy we have an x squared we've got this can be divided we have an x over here let's write this as a separable equation so we already ate our domain restriction no problem let's just start simplifying so V over x squared we know that exponents distribute across multiplication and division let's divide this let's move our X's and our D X's on one side RVs and D B's are already on an appropriate side so we're going to get this V squared DVD on the right hand side well if we multiply by x squared we'll get X cubed over one plus X to the fourth to the one-half power and then it's a nice little convention we have that we can separate that demand that derivative or the into that differential sort of form so let's make sure it works this led us to the idea of e then we use our V to replace our wise take a derivative to replace this whole mess of crap with DV DX and it works out nicely perceptible so we've separated our variables we have these TVs we have X's DX's we're ready to take an integral on both sides so left hand side let's see one third b cubed right hand side looks like the basic use of how that works is very similar to most of these embedded derivatives where you have to solve for the piece that you're trying to substitute so D you over 4 equals x cubed DX that's great so we give this integral we do so we get this integral of x cubed DX note we call that D over 4 1 plus X to the fourth to the 1/2 no we're going to do you two 1/2 we write in that just a bit let's pull the 1/4 out we'll have integral of U to the negative 1/2 do you okay that's 1/4 let's see we add 1/2 excrement plus our constant 4 times 1/2 that's 2 so 1/2 you to the White House yeah but you is one plus X to the fourth and then to the 1/2 plus C let's go ahead and write that what else can we do what would you do what let's think about replacing V with what V is equal to but before that it's often nice to solve for B as much as possible in this case we're going to at least want to multiply by three everywhere so I'm gonna call this C sub 1 and C sub 1 and C sub 1 so when I multiply by 3 I can wrap that up a little nicer so V Q equals 1/2 on the right this way too because I'm seeing a fraction here so I want 1 plus X to the fourth to the 1/2 over 2 plus C sub 1 and I'm gonna multiply everything by 3 so 3 times 1/3 gives us B cube ok times 3 times 3 because I've gotta distribute the right hand side now I'm gonna wrap this up I'm gonna wrap this up as a C but I don't so I'm seeing this this fraction maybe I want to write this as one fraction so here's another thing that we can do if we put this over to the 1/3 let's see common denominator of 2 went I have to multiply by 2 over 2 yeah so I would get this since 60 said whatever to the point is I don't care whether it's 3 C sub 1 or 6 east of 106 million C sub 1 it's still arbitrary does not matter what that is and so when we write this as one fraction and we do a plus 6 C sub 1 don't worry about that just put a plus C that arbitrary constant does not matter what that is you will have this over to though that was all nature of getting common denominators so rest of us manage is this some algebra let's let's go ahead and let's replace our are you with what X is let's go ahead and put it over here so reviews must be can be multiplied everything by 3 we know that arbitrary does mean arbitrate the matter with that is let's wrap up all of our constants together as a plus C and now we are ready let's replace this with what V equals so V is excellent so we don't use this we already have these use this one these x times y so this would be x y cubed all the stuff that means we're going to get X cubed times y cubed okay and this is the reason why I chose right this is one fraction because now we can divide both sides by X cubed we already have our domain restriction we can do that if we divided by X cubed we just now have X cubed on the bottom of one fraction instead of splitting this over two fractions it's a reason why we do it so instead of rewriting all this we're gonna go okay yes let's just divide everything by X cube this is gone we get X cubed and that's what we're looking for okay the same answer done a different way with Bernoulli but this time you have to deal with a lot of those that technique this was basic but it was important for you to see what we actually can do is synthetic derivative technique does it always have to be wise no it involved X's but if it does involve X's darn well better make sure that it includes the whole entire piece surrounding you by DX all right also the end this one this one's very special we can go backwards sometimes so nothing else is working for you and you see that that looks it's triggering something your head like man that looks nothing like like the result of a product rule do it call that V then solve your V for y and you can replace all your otherwise with the B's and x's and that's exactly we want one dependent one independent variable it makes sense I hope you see the utility in this technique how it really does make stuff doesn't look a lot more streamlined but at least you get another way and it can be a lot easier than something's homogeneous or Bernoulli or another technique so I hope I've made this make sense to you practice them start looking for them sometimes if you look at hey I see that and the more you the more you do them the the more often you'll start seeing these embedded derivatives ago I can do it that way man that saved me a headache as far as this technique is that was really hard so I would encourage you go back and look at these examples from the previous videos and see which one you would rather do again people like homogeneous because it's predictable and same thing with renewed is very predictable but this can save us time so it's kind of a double-edged sword there so anyway we're gonna move on and I'll show you a different substitution technique involving some reducible second-order derivative of differential equations next time have a great day you
