Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 10.4:  Using Polar Coordinates and Polar Equations
so now for our discussion on Polar coordinates um I already handed this out to you guys but if you are watching this later get yourself this a polar coordinate graph and don't get dizzy oh you're tripping out now um get yourself one of these it's polar coordinate graph paper just type it into the internet and you can find it this will help you learn how to graph polar coordinates so this is what these people are going to be using uh for right now I'm going to just draw it on the I won't draw all these lines and stuff um because you'll be able to follow along if you have this so if you don't have this get it right now press pause and go polar cor graph paper enter and then print it and then watch this video okay that was for them word you guys since I like you guys I give you a present but there people have find themselves so polar coordinates this is a way to represent curves with something other than rectangular coordinates now we already learned parametric but sometimes it's easier nicer or more relevant to use polar coordinates and we're going to show I'm going to show you how to do that so it's just a different way to represent curves without x's and y's with something a little different here's how it works it's going to look really similar to uh a lot of trigonometry you've done because hey polar coordinates deals with angles it's going to be based on a lot of trigonometry so here it goes polar coordinates polar coordinates look like this we start with something called the polar axis which takes the place of the xais and then we have this point O which is our our origin so we have o the origin or the pole we got the polar axis this is always going to be our initial side like where we where we start our angle we start our motion so we start here at the polar axis and then we're going to go up or we're going to go down angularly around the pole does that make sense the pole is our origin uh it should be very similar to drawing any angle that you have ever drawn so we're going to start the polar axis we're going to go up or we're going to go down um with an angle Theta so we're going to go up and we'll have this other side now what's different about polar coordinates is it's not just an angle you don't go forever with a a ray a segment of a line you actually stop you have this this terminal point what that P is that P is defined by R Theta where R is the length of that segment and Theta is the angle in relation to your polar axis so Theta gives us our angle p is some point and R is the distance from o your origin your pole and P your point and the most basic sense of it that's it uh does it look familiar to you at least we' drawn lots of angles like this we have our initial side we have our terminal side for our Angle now that's just called the polar axis it goes around a pole that's our Point O our origin goes for some angle up or down we'll talk about positive versus negative in just a moment uh the distance of that between o and P is is our R uh it doesn't go forever you see in this way you could actually graph a curve and here's what it says go up a little bit and go out and then if I wanted to make a curve I could vary the r vary that distance and Vary the angle it would give me a curve around that does that make sense so the r is is some sort of a distance it doesn't just go on forever and ever and ever that doesn't happen with polar coordinates so couple of little notes for us if Theta is positive do you guys remember this if Theta is positive this means that we're going in a certain direction what direction are we going if Theta is POS positive yeah that's right counterclockwise would be positive clockwise would be a negative angle also it's interesting but your distance r r can be positive or or R can be negative as well and I'll talk about that in just a moment in fact let me do it right now if R is positive then how your angles look is this listen carefully because we're going to do a few examples but I want you to to really get it if R is positive then what we would do is we'd have our our polar axis and we'd have some sort of an angle Theta let's assume it's a positive angle it's going counterclockwise if R is positive we get that look to it we just get okay you use your angle and R is positive that's where your your side actually is are you with me on this one it's just like what we started u compare that to this if R and this would be some point R comma Theta notice how your your coordin orates are no longer in terms of X and Y your coordinates are given by the length of your ray oh sorry the length of your line segment and the angle that it's creating with the the polar axis does that make sense to you so it's not X and Y it's hey how long the the segment is and where the angle is in relation to your your initial side your uh polar axis now if R is negative here's how it works you'll still use your f you'll still use your your angle if it's positive will go clockwise if it's sorry counterclockwise if it's negative will go clockwise you'll still use that this would be where your point would be if you had a positive R if you have a negative R then here's what you do you use that angle you find where that point is and then you reflect that about the origin so basically you go okay well it's not over here a NE this would be a positive r a negative R goes 180 de in the opposite direction for the same length so basically for uh for negative R we use the the Theta as normal and then we just go in the opposite direction that's the the idea so be okay with this so far now take out that graph paper we're going to do a couple examples so just to get really used to this we go through maybe three four five examples whatever to so we feel comfortable let's start with something real simple we're going to start with 1 comma 2 piun over 3 now to get ju just to get started we got to be used to naming what these these coordinates are they're not x's and y's what's the one giving you right here one unit is giving the length so I want you to look at your your graph paper if you look at it there's some circles right there's some circles in your graph paper there's uh one little circle and then there's another one there's another one that keeps going out and out I see 1 2 3 4 I count five concentric circles did you guys see that too so if you have five concentric circles the distance of that first Circle would be a unit of one and then the second would be a unit of two and then three and then four and then five so if R is one you're not going to graph the entire length of your your circle you just go to the first little concentric Circle and that would be the your R make sense now I can't show that because I don't have this on the board uh but what we do here is we say okay well if you have this on your circles you don't need this this is a rectangular coordinate system I'm doing this just for for for the sake of quadrants okay so we see where the quadrants are so really this doesn't have to be here and this doesn't have to be here and neither does this one the idea is your x axis is like your polar axis your origin is still your origin now what's my R again everybody one what's my Theta 2 is it positive or negative so positive means I'm going to be going counterclockwise until I reach 2 pi so on your it's like a unit circle just has more units to it so go to 2 piun 3 is 2i 3 in the first quadrant is it in the second quadrant yeah so we'd say okay well 2 pi over 3 is roughly let's see Pi 3 roughly right here like that so that's 2 pi over 3 we always always label our polar coordinates always we label the angle and we label the distance are you with me always label it so um now we've done the angle but that that's only half the battle okay we've just done the angle now we got to do the the length of our segment how long should this R be so I'm not going to go forever I'm going to just go to for you guys it's going to be on that first little circle and that's where our point is so F you okay with that and this we label it as 1 comma 2 piun 3 that way we have a angle of positive 2 piun 3 counterclockwise we have a length of 1 one so far so good okay let's do some more let's do 3 comma piun over 4 don't label these X and Y axes they're not if you label it any anything this would be your polar axis this would be the p 2 axis this would be the polar axis in the negative direction or the pi axis 0 and Pi this would be the 3 Pi 2 axis they're not x's and y's anymore because we're not even talking about that okay we're talking about polar coordinates so let's start uh here's our polar axis we're going to start at the origin uh what's our R please R good what's our anglea so should I go clockwise or counterclockwise clockwise say it again clse clockwise from here that would be this way if this isun 2 thenk 4 it should be on your graph right 4 just well it doesn't say it might not say negative pi 4 it might say what is it 7 Pi 4 that's right and if you think about that here's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 is co-terminal with negative P4 okay we're going to label it we got to label it correctly the angle is going negatively at Pi 4 how long do I make my my segment here how long is that so I'm going to go to on you guys the third concentric Circle so one would be one two would be two three would be three on a graph like this this is why it's important for you to label it you don't just put a point randomly like this you say okay this angle is p 4 and we're going to three so we'd have 3 andk 4 and you'll that so here we have one so be located with the idea of polar coordinates easy medium hard once you get to hang a bit not too bad it's just an angle you know about angles and now that you have that nice isn't that graph paper nice isn't that kind of cool go oh yeah it goes out three it's kind of nice so let's continue we'll do uh maybe I don't know two more I'll show you what to do with negative RS okay how about this one so just getting the habit of it what's our R please what's our Theta is Theta going to move in the counterclockwise direction or the clockwise Direction counterclockwise counterclockwise from our polar axis how much is it going to go up or down up okay that is counterclockwise Pi 3 is right about there so we're going to label it positive piun 3 now here's the deal if we have positive 3 we also have an R of wait a minute so here's what we do and I showed you this up here if we stop this at positive2 is that my correct line no what I do is I find the 180° opposite uh Ray than that so for our case pi over 3 well we're going to go what is that line down here 1 2 3 4 pi over 3 did you guys find the 4 pi over 3 it's that the graph is kind of nice because you just follow it straight down but it would be 4 Pi 3 so we go Okay cool so we're going to go down here we'll have two and how we label it we don't label this as 4 Pi 3 what we label it as is -2 p over three we label the original angle that we had and then we label the negative distance out of that and that's the idea does that make sense to you so we've had positive angles we have negative angles we have positive R now let's do one last one and you guys went to the second concentric Circle correct okay what direction am I going am I going to go in the clockwise direction or the counterclockwise Direction quickly say it again what is it clockwise okay uh what how far am I going one okay that was very ambiguous question on my angle how far am I going three so this is one Pi this is two Pi this is three so when I do this you're gonna have to show that you go okay here's 1 Pi 2 pi 3 Pi we label that 3 Pi in the negative Direction so 3 Pi the direction matters here now how far out are we going to go one one so you're going to go to your first concentric Circle and label that one and this is the point one comma -3 Pi in terms of polar coordinates okay I want to make sure that you guys are okay with that so far that's pretty much everybody guys over here are we okay with it so you know how angles work positive angles mean counterclockwise negative angles mean clockwise negative positive RS mean you just go wherever you're at that certain distance so one or two or three or four negative RS mean that you go the the correct angle and then you just make it Opposite on the opposite line from that have I explained this one enough for you guys understand it okay now I want to get into something a little bit a little bit different I want to start switching between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates and between rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates so I'm going to show you how to do it super not that hard okay not hard at all provided you understand what's going on on these polar coordinates so if we're to draw one of these if we just draw some general polar coordinate we'll have an R we'll have a point we have a polar axis and we've got an angle now our idea is let's translate between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates if we do it well every rectangular coordinate in the world has an X component and a y component doesn't it well if we want to make an X component here's our origin where we start our X component is going to be which direction up down or left right and it's going to go over to however far that point is right there does that make sense and that would be our X component and our y component would be well how far we rise from here to here well that would be little bit that would be our y component does that look familiar to you what angle is that 9° we drop a perpendicular well now can we come up with some relationships with this angle and the triangle uh hello what class is that all about you've Tak trigonometry so some simple basic trigonometry lets us convert between polar and rectangular coordinates and here's how it works um we have a couple relationships with this we have cosine Theta we have sin Theta we have tangent Theta and then we have the Pythagorean relationship R 2 let's go over cosine we're going to go through very quickly because it's complete review uh cosine Theta is what over what isent is r s pyan r s x if we do just a little bit of manipulation with this well then what we can find is could you solve this for X how do you solve it for X well x = r * cosine could you solve that for y then y = r * sin thet uh do you guys see it we just have our x coordinate and our y coordinate that's really what we need for that that's it now a couple other things we're going to use we're going to use tangental YX we're also going to use this Pythagorean identity a lot so I'm going to write those well we already have them written down but this is another thing that we have so I'll write it twice R 2 = x^2 + y^2 these things are what we use to go between polar and rectangular coordinates now let's give this a try so let's say I give you 4 comma Pi 6 what have I given you have I given you rectangular coordinates have I given you polar coordinates polar what gives it away yeah the four doesn't CU you mean that could be an X but that that's definitely a polar coordinate because we got the pi over 6 now here's what I want you to do every time no matter whether you're going between polar and rectangular or rectangular and polar I want you to graph these first graph the point cuz what can happen especially when you go between rectangular and polar you can mess up the quadrant and so I want you to make sure these points end up in the correct quadrants okie dokie so let's graph that we're going to do it very quickly graph all these really quick you can do it on your graph paper you can do it uh just writing out like I'm doing pi over 6 you guys know where pi over 6 is is it up or down counterclockwise or clockwise that's right about there how far out do we go so you're going to go four concentric circles out so four and an angle of pi/ 6 here's the point no pun intended that is the point but uh the point is what quadrant is it in so we better make sure that when we convert this to rectangular coordinates that our rectangular coordinates end up in quadrant one it's got to be the same point it's need to represent the same point okay are you sure you're okay with this yes got to the same thing so do you know what your R is what your R do you know what your Theta is can you convert that using that formula yes it's really easy so the x coordinate would equal well R is 4 * cosine of isun / 6 might be useful to have a unit circle handy that gives you those relationships for like Pi s and cosine of pi 6 what ones are that we're going to use y y is going to equal well look at y y says take your R multiply by S of your Theta and if you do that you automatically get your rectangular coordinates really really really nice X is 4 * can you tell me what's cosine of pi 6 do you know that's what it is2 cosine counts down s counts up 4 * s ofk 6 1 so that means that we're going to get x = 2 < tk3 Y = 2 can you make a point out of that so write this as a point our point is what's the x coordinate and your what coordinate two so what we're saying here is that this point represented as Polar coordinates Pi 6 Sorry 4 comma Pi 6 where we have an angle Pi 6 and length of four is also represented by the rectangular coordinate 2K3 comma 2 is it in the same quadrant X is positive Y is positive it's got to be up there and that's exactly how you represent that make sense kind of neat right interesting at least let's do a few more to get the hang of this okay we're going to change this uh what have I given you have I given you rectangular rectangular have I given you polar what have I given you sure what tells you that one Pi yeah it's an angle okay so let's go ahead and we're going to change these into rectangular I want you guys to do it so all we need to do is identify the r identify Thea and use these two formulas X is given by this that's x coordinate Y is given by that that's a y coordinate go for it what should the first thing you be well what should you do first graph why do we graph make sure it's in the right corner cuz I told you to but yeah make sure it's in the right right leard said Leonard said forget Simon what quadrant did we end up in end up in three so our Point better be in quadrant 3 so we go okay well wait a minute uh X is R cosine Theta so x isk22 * cosine < 4 don't get these two things confused X is with cosine Y is with s which I guess that's that's not that's pretty obvious right because when you have a unit circle it's cosine sign isn't it that's X and Y X and Y same same thing so when we have this x isga < tk2 * > 2 2 and Y is < tk2 * 2 two wait a minute that's interesting what's this going to give you now why is interesting can you come with the point with these two yeah does that fit well with where we're at on our polar coordinates yes yeah that's a 45° angle from here that's right in the right in the middle of our 90° angle and it's down Square < TK of two well it's downare < TK of two that's 1 2 + 1 2 and then we take a square root so that's exactly what that is is11 show hands feel okay with our our changing now we can also go back we can change between rectangular and polar so we did from Polar to rectangular now rectangular to Polar this is where the quad really does come into play and you're going to see that on a lot of these examples so let's say that I give you this one -1 comma 1 is it apparent to you that that right there is in rectangular coordinates it doesn't have an obvious Angle now usually I'll be a little bit more uh explicit here I'll say change this rectangular coordinate coordinates pair into ordered pair rectangular ordered pair into Polar coordinates I'll tell you explicitly right now I'm just going to tell you in words that's rectangular we want to change it into Polar well what we to do what do we need to know in order to change something from rectangular to Polar right now we have X and Y what do we want to have for Polar we want R we got to have R what else do we want an angle an angle Theta that's right well you know what two of these things are going to give that to us and it's not going to be very nice to use these cuz this has both of our our unknowns in it doesn't it that has both of our unknowns in it both oh but this one this one has both of the things that we know in it doesn't it this one has both of the things that we know in it so to go from Polar to rectangular we use these two that's why I have listed to go from rectangular to Polar we use the other two does that make sense to you I'll show you exactly how how that works right now so uh r s r^2 = x^2 + y^2 so in our case uh we know X and we know y so let's do it R2 is going to be what please which equals okay okay how about R rals that's right sare root of two now kind of kind of and here's where it works um you see how when we do a square root you typically put a plus or a minus okay we're going to omit the Plus or the minus but that's what can mess up your quadrant is because we we get that right there so we're going to take care of the correct quadrant with our angle we're always going to try to make a positive angle we're always going to try to make it be in the in the correct quadrant but why you why this screws up is because when you take a square root we typically omit the negative here does does that make sense to you you understand why we can mess this up okay so R isun 2 that's nice we know how long this line segment is going to be uh what's the other thing we got to find Thea so here's part number one here's part number two if tangent Theta equal YX and again the reason why I'm using tangent right now is because it relates the two pieces we know we know X and we know y we didn't know R to start with we didn't know R to start with so if we know X and Y then tan theta equals what's our y yeah let's get this these ones right 1 over so that's going to be what's tanal 1 what's the angle going to be there do you know you actually have choices here there's a lot of angles that are going to give you tan Thal 1 a lot of them an infinite number of them we got to pick the right one what we're looking for is a positive angle between 0 and 2 pi we don't want like 77 pi over whatever I don't want that okay I want something between 0 and 2 pi I want to be positive so let's look at what happened this is what we should have done first this was a rectangular system so if we plot this points what quadrant is it in two yeah it's right there and what we want is we want to associate the angle to this and the length to this we want to convert that rectangular Point into a polar coordinate so far so good we've already done part of it we know that this distance is going to be the < TK of two but we got to pick the angle correctly so that we get the positive angle out of it what you could do you could say well you know what this is negative pi over 4 that would give that to you but then you'd have to use the negative root of two to get there do you guys see what I'm talking about since we avoided the < TK 2 we can't use thek 4 that's not going to do that so if ever you get the negative angle like man that's in the the wrong quadrant just add pi to it for tangent and it's going to make it in the correct quadrant so for us we we think about this first this is why we graph it first to make sure you have the correct quadrant so F if you understand understand that idea got to have the correct quadrant so plot your rectangulars first and then start looking for your angle so if we're going to be in quadrant 2 and we have to have tangent of our angle equal 1 we're going to have to be at 3 pi over 4 using your circle or think back to your trigonometry this is going to have to be 3 4 okay I need to make sure this makes sense to you this to me is a little bit harder than this one this's very straightforward this is a little bit different are you guys okay with that one yes are you seeing how important it is to graph your point first so you know what quadrant you're in okay now let's put it together uh what polar coordinates do we have what's our our point < tk2 and 3 that's it so we know we're going to go 3 4 and we have a length ofun of two and that's it so far so good are you sure okay let me show you one more and then we'll go on to Symmetry and how to graph these these St so I give you a rectangular rectangular coordinate system order pair 3a4 uh what quadrant is that going to me do you know four so that's going to be one two 3 1 2 3 4 so we're going to be down here somewhere what we want is that distance and this angle so far so good mhm let's do it why don't you guys go through it I want you to find at least the r go ahead and find the r right now and then get down to the trigonometric relationship that's going to allow us to find the Theta so go for it for let's see x² Y 2 R is equal to the square root of what 25 which is five oh perfect R is five I like it we already have half of our work done did you find R is 5 show you got it perfect okay now do you notice we're omitting the neg five mhm okay now what else do we need tent why tangent why are we using tangent not s or cosine what's tangent compare and that's what we want we're given an X and Y So Tan th equal okay what angle is going to give you4 this one was easy it's 1 it's somewhere that's actually on our unit circle yeah if it had been root3 over2 be easy or negative < tk2 over2 orative one2 positive2 or any any of those nice ones if it's not nice like this or it's not on your unit circle don't make it harder than it is how do you solve for angles do an inverse = tan inverse of -43 you with me on that one now here's the deal don't let me don't let me mess you up here but here's the deal check it out this tan inverse is based on4 over 34 or 3a4 it's going to be in the correct quadrant it has to be there but it's going to be negative this is a negative angle and I don't want that so here's how I know it's negative by the way positive angles give you positive tangents this is tangent negative angles give you negative tangents therefore when I go in reverse tan inverse of negatives give me negative angles tan inverse of positive give me positive angles this will be a negative angle but it will be in the correct quadrant here's how you remedy that if you have something that's in the correct quadrant but it's negative add a full circle to it just add 2 pi and it will make it positive so what we're going to do is we're going to add 2 pi and this is to make positive so now we have it our R is five it's going to be ugly looking but our angle is this listen this is our Theta right this is an angle it's tan inverse of -43 + 2 pi it's a stupid looking angle but that's the angle that's exactly what that is did that one make sense to you a little bit could that be considered like an answer you put down or do you actually have to use calc this is fine this is exact okay if you put your calculator radians and you actually do it you can find an approximation for that uh but if you did this in radians it's going to be negative it's going to be a negative angle we want just to add 2 pi to that or 6.28 roughly on your calculator and then you get that whatever that is can I can we move on a little bit okay what I want to do now as the last thing we'll do today I want to show you how to find a rectangular equation from a polar equation this is very interesting and very useful for us because we're used to rectangular equations we're not used to polar equations we need to get used to them we need to get used to look at them go oh that's uh ellipse oh that's uh whatever it is and this is one way that we do that we start by just changing some basic easat so right now we're going to convert a polar equation into a rectangular equation now here's the deal when you convert a polar equation to a rectangular equation we need something that relates these two ideas the only thing that really relates these two ideas to us is this the Pythagorean identity or the Pythagorean theorem for us R2 equals x s+ y^2 that has X's that has y's that has RS you with me the the thetas are going to be tied up into in one of these things so we're not worried so much about that right now uh well actually well I'll show you I'll show you how that that relates but start with something like the Pythagorean theorem or identity and try to work with it if you remember with parametric equations we actually did this did something very similar remember how we had like uh xal something cosine Theta y equal something sin Theta and we use the Pythagorean identity to put them together really similar idea so here we go R2 = + y^2 what we're going to try to do we're trying to make an r s up here somewhere now the only way that I can see how to do that is well what if I just multiply both sides by R well then what this this is going remember this is what we're trying to get is R2 equals equals something so to use a substitution so if R2 equals 2 * R * sin Theta well this is great if we have an r s now we can make a substitution to to change the r s into something in terms of X and Y remember a polar equation has RS and thetas right rectangular equations don't they have x's and y's so if I can find r s some somewhere in there how much is r s equal to so then R 2 becomes X2 + y^2 this is R 2 I'll do one more step in a moment quick show hands you okay with that so far now the next part of it this is kind of fun do you remember that x = r cosine the do you remember that y = r sin th remember that we had it up here a while back which one of these do you see in our equation right now X and Y I see X and Y this is this is I don't want to change it back okay I already had polar equation I want rectangular so what my goal here is if I'm listen listen I you need to get the goal the goal is if you have a polar and I want rectangular I don't want RS I don't want thetas I want x's and I want y's does that make sense so with our R we go let's just multiply both sides R we get r s that's X2 y^ s hey halfway done on the right hand side we got R sin Theta let's do it all at once how much is R sin Theta why because I asked you never too old to bring back that joke love that okay yeah you're exactly right so this is X2 + y^2 this is 2 y good two is there this is very confidently said I like when you're little when you're like seven why why why no no I said why hey is everything in terms of X and Y yes you're done that is a rectangular equation isn't it if it's all in terms of X and Y you're done now do you know what it looks like no can you make it into something you know what it looks like sure yes yes so practically you're done in actuality you can make it actually look like something and I'm going to do this for you so that you see what's going on I'm going to go move kind of quickly through it uh but here's the idea did I explain it well enough for you you guys to see that between polar and rectangular you want to get rid of RS and thetas you want to get x's and y's Square both sides if you have just an R hey that's x y s r sin thet is y r cosine Theta that's X we can put that in there so here we go let's say say I get everything so basically we're done but but not done we can do more if I get everything to one side I end up getting X2 + y^ 2 - 2 y = 0 yes no if I complete the square I get x^2 + y^2 - 2 y take half this number Square it add it to both sides remember completing the square yes that's now a perfect square trinomial x^2 + y - 1 this is half this number that's how you complete the square I don't have time to explain how to do that you should know how to complete the square but once we do we now have x^2 + y - 1 2 equals 1 and oh my gosh holy cow that's something that we should know what that is what shape is that in terms of a rectangular equation a circle everybody what is the radius of the circle remember this is the radius squared yes can you find the center of this circle zero nothing add subtract it's Z and it's opposite of what you want to say it is0 and the center 0 1 so this is really a circle the center is at 01 the radius is one could you graph it just go to 0 one for the center go up one left one right one down one make a circle and that's exactly what that thing is going to look like now that's a little bit more concise in terms of the equation but once we get a handle on oh well that's that's what this looks like that's a circle we can start seeing these things a little bit better we're going to get some really really cool looking graphs out of our polar equations that we wouldn't be able to get to get with rectangular or that would be really hard to get with rectang rectangular because with rectangular you have these problems with not being functions now that's not a obviously not a function it's a circle uh but we have some problems with rectangular equations that just make it really hard and so with polar we're going to learn how to graph next time we'll learn about Symmetry and then we'll learn how to use that to our advantage with me did I explain it well enough today for you okay we're going to graph some of these polar equations and the what I put on the board here is a way that you can eliminate a lot of the work a lot of the work here so we have symmetry you'll remember from like your your rectangular equations that we can if we can have even functions we can have odd functions we have functions that are symmetrical about well the X and Y axis like I said and and about the origin we have the same thing with polar equations so here's how you determine that if you can take so suppose we have some function R equals F of theta so that what that means that means that we have a polar equation here if you can take and plug in Theta and it gives you back your original function that means that this polar equation is going to be symmetric about the polar axis the polar axis is the one that goes this way it's the one where we start we talked about that last time so it's going to be your x-axis so it's just going to be flippy floppy across that axis does that make sense now if we plug in and this is a little weird but if you plug in Pius Theta and it gives us back our original function that means that we're symmetric about the pial 2 axis so uh th = 2 that is this one p/2 goes this way remember that from our unit circle and from our polar graphs that we we did this way so it's flippy floppy across kind of the Y AIS here that's the idea if we have this one which I don't know that we're going to use that very often but if we have when you plug in theta plus pi it gives you negative of our original function that means that we're symmetric about the origin you could take it rotate at 180° and that's the same exact symmetry that we're talking about your fans be okay with this now I'm going to show you how to use it right now so simple example not a hard one I just want want to show you one idea of symmetry I'll show you how to graph these then I'll kind kind of extend this concept so let's say that we have this equation r = 1 + cosine thet r = 1 + cosine Theta first first thing look for any symmetry well actually you know what the first thing make sure it's a polar equation is that a polar equation how can you tell it's polar R that's right are there any X's or y's no no X's or y's and there's R and Theta that means you got a polar equation here after you determine it's a polar equation cuz sometimes you're going to have to convert it into polar equations and that's can be kind of tricky I'll show you how to do that in one of these examples next thing we check for check for any symmetry so here's how you check for symmetry check for this one first go in this order so here's our symmetry let's suppose I have F of theta well F of theta is 1 + cosine Theta we know this because R is a function of theta so F of theta equals just that function so set your F of theta equal to your equation 1+ the right side of your equation 1 plus cosine Theta now how symmetry works is you take Theta or you take Pius Theta or you take theta plus pi and you plug it into your equation you plug it in here so we're going to say all right well um f of theta then is 1 + cine of thet quick head now if you're okay you understand the concept here so here's what we're checking for we're saying hey uh if I plug in negative Theta is it going to give me the same thing as when I plug in positive Theta because if it is that's symmetric about the xaxis the polar axis here make sense so what what we've done is said okay what we're trying to see is does this give me this if it does then these two things are equal well this is going to require you to use some identities so in our case 1 plus cosine of theta if you know this identity cosine of theta is the same as cosine positive Theta because if you think of cosine cosine is an even function it's symmetric about the Y so remember that one it goes this way it's it's symmetric you fold it over on itself what that means is that cos is the same as cosine Theta if you want to look up that identity it's in there it's there well now check it out is this the same as what we started with yeah so what that says is that F of theta hey here is the same thing as F OFA therefore this says and you're going to State this out this says that this is symmetric about the PO axis so you okay with with that one now we could stop there or we could check for more symmetry I'm going to stop there because I know it's not going to satisfy these other two and we can deal with this one a little bit differently than finding every possible symmetry so here's the idea think think about this think about why this helps you out if you know that something's symmetric about your x-axis your polar axis then if we can find this half we automatically find this half does that make sense so what we're going to do is we're just going to plug in the angles from 0 to Pi because if we can plug in from 0 to Pi then we can find out pi to 2 pi make sense so we use the Symmetry to eliminate like half our work or 34s of our work if we have double symmetry like across p/ 2 and the polar axis it's kind of nice so here's how I'm going to show you how to graph it um how to graph it first thing you do step one plug in points step two think that's it you got to think about it you got to take those points and think about how the Symmetry Works think about what the what the points are doing uh and I'll I'll show you that right now this is the reason why we learned how to plot polar coordinates is for this right here so one option you have and this is a really good option start by creating a table now the type of table we're going to use it it almost looks like a graph of x and y it's like a rectangular system but you're using R and Theta here now it's not this is not the graph of our function it's just a way that you can organize your points does that make sense to you better than a t table uh for us so here's what we're going to do we're going to have r on this axis we're going to have Theta on this axis use value OFA to find out values of R of course our R is our dependent variable Theta is the one that you pluging in stuff to okay that's your independent variable plug in this you get out that don't go the other way around it's really hard to do that so plug in values of your Theta get out values of your R also plug in values of your Theta that are easy don't pick up let's let's put in pi over 16 that's a good one no don't do that what are some easy values of of theta to plug in think easier easier Z zero let's plug in zero zero is a great one a great one now plug in some other ones Pi pi over six okay um when you do that we can plug in P over four I'm not going to plug in P six get a good picture without that one uh if you need to flesh this thing out more then you use stuff like Pi 6 Pi 3 let's plug in stuff like Pi / 2 let's plug in stuff like 4 let's do stuff like what's the next one 3K 4 let's plug in stuff like Pi again can you explain to me why I'm stopping at PI right now get half it get the other half I know I'm symmetric if I go to zero to Pi on this particular graph because I don't have a two Theta I just have a Theta right here if I just have a Theta that means I'm going to go from zero to Pi that's going to be My Graph the other half is going to be on the bottom side it's going to be symmetric about the the xaxis so if things feel okay with this so far yes no okay now let's plug them in uh we're going to go kind of quickly here because I'm going to assume that you're pretty good at plugging these things in so let's plug in zero where am I plugging in zero coine yeah let's plug in zero what's cosine of Z plus one so when I plug in zero notice this is not a polar graph right now all I'm doing is listing out my points if I plug in Theta equal 0 I I get out two does that make sense to you okay now let's plug in pi over 4 if I plug in pi over 4 what's cosine Pi 4 < tk2 2 < tk2 over two plus one plus one how much is that 1 1+ < tk2 over2 whatever that happens to be so 1 + < tk2 over2 okay that's up it's above one it's not it's not to two it's like uh 2.71 I think isn't it somewhere around there no I mean two cuz you're adding one to it so I I'm you're right one point shoot figured out what is that I lost track of my math in my head 1.7 something okay 1.7 you're right 1.7 uh let's keep going P pi two if I plug into 2 what's cosine 2 and then plus one so we're just using some Tri here all right how about 3un 4 what's uh what's cosine of 3K 4 NE < tk2 over2 okay so 1 minus < tk2 over2 how much is that 1- tk2 two how much is it about so we're done and then lastly we have so one minus so this is one this is 1us and lastly cosine of pi everybody what's cosine of pi 1+ 1 is how much okay so we have this idea our radius our R is going from two gradually down to zero does that make sense to you this giving you just a picture of what the r is doing what the length of R is doing now we're going to put these ideas together in our polar graph right now but I want to know firstly are you okay with getting all these points show hands if you are if is this a polar graph no it's just relating Theta to R so that we can follow it almost like a t table for X and Y now we're going to translate this to a polar graph so here's p/ 2 AIS here's zero so here we go hey um when our angle is zero what's our R when our angle zero so at angle where is angle zero where is it right on what right on the Polar axis so right here so when we're at angle zero remember all the graphing we did last time we that that's why we did this so we can plot these points that's the nice thing about it so we have this uh at angle zero we have two so we have one point right there so can you okay with this one so far now where's pi over4 so if that's Pi 4 what's our r value at pi over 4 about 1.7 or so so here's what we're going to do we're going to imagine this is 1.7 our point should be right there so just take that idea and move it up on that that line does that make sense to you are you sure I don't want to lose you here I want to make sure that you're okay with it do you get how we're taking these values and we're just now putting this them on this graph it's just a different way to think about it this was angled zero you had two hey angle of zero I have two angle of pi over 4 I have one I have 1.7 uh angle of Pi 4 I have 1.7 it's going to be less than this Distance by just a little bit so far so good now we go to the next one at Pi / 2 what's our R well that's an easy one at Pi / 2 we're at one that should be a little lower actually okay now at 3 p over 4 where's 3 pi over 4 yeah it's right here how much are we at 3 pi over 4 mhm so think about how much that is with a calculator or something plug in 1us < tk2 over2 get an approximation it's about 2 about3 yeah so here's check it out here's your here's your scale correct so we have 3 it's about right there and Lastly lastly when I plug in pi so I'm going when I plug in pi what's my r that means I'm at the origin okay I really need to make sure that you are okay with this do you see that at zero work two angle of zero we're at two angle of pi over 4 we're at 1.7 roughly uh pi over 2 we're at about one well exactly one atunk 3 Pi 4 We're AT3 at Pi we're at zero Oh wait we're at zero so yeah it has an angle but has no distance there we're right at the origin right at the the the pole honestly you guys feel okay with that one now we use this idea this this idea of well R is shrinking as we're going down to graph this so does it look like R is going to shrink the the r shrinking means that these points are going to always get closer and closer and closer to our pole because we always start here so how this is going to look it's not going to do weird things because our if it did weird things our R would be shrinking then expanding then shrinking and it's not doing that our R is is constantly shrinking constantly decreasing what this looks like is almost like the start of a spiral like that that's how that looks it's kind of cool right now what else do we know about this that's why we did symmetry so we didn't have to graph all the rest of it so if we know it's symmetrical then all we got to do is put these points at the same spots but on the other side of our axis and we get this that's does any know what that's called actually what's it look like if you turn your head to the side a heart actually kind of looks like a butt but it's not called the it's not called the buid it looks like a heart so they call it the cardioid uh this is called the cardioid right here and it kind of does look like a butt though doesn't it it's horrible I always thought like this should be the buyid but it's a cardioid because it looks like a heart I told you you're going to draw some pretty pictures today sure F feel okay with this one that's the idea find out if it's polar equation or not if it is great if it's not make it a polar equation after that find out your symmetry you could have three types of symmetry as I've talked about over here after you find your symmetry use it so don't be doing more work than you have to here if I know it's symmetric about the polar axis I'm going to go from 0 to Pi no problem flippy floppy right over the polar axis and we have ourselves our gra so far so good okay we're going to continue this are there any questions before we continue am I going too fast or am I explaining it well enough for you okay so let's do it okay R = 2 cosine 2 th what's the first thing that we look for in this type of graphing that we're doing what kind of Co yeah what time of equation it is is it polar is it rectangular what is it it's polar right now is it easy to tell for you yeah should be pretty easy there's no X's no y's it's just R and Theta so that's nice it's very concise too right I me it's kind of weird that that concise of a graph can give it give such a complex picture it's kind of cool so now that we've determined that this is a polar equation what's the next thing that we're going to do say what symmetry are we going to start plugging in points right now no it's a bad idea because we don't even know our symmetry don't even know what points to plug in so let's start plugging in some points I'm sorry um that was bad bad I said that the wrong way so we can't start plugging in some points if I said plug in some points uh we need to find symmetry so we know what points to plug in let's do our symmetry let's start with the same one let's start with we know that F of theta is 2 cosine 2 Theta let's think about F of theta F of theta what's the only thing that's going to change mhm so this would be 2 cosine 2 * well if you look at that 2 * is -2 now you guys tell me how much is cosine of -2 thet equal to according to the identity that we just used what is it it says here that cosine is same as cosine thet therefore cosine -2 th is the same thing as cosine 2 does that show you any symmetry in this problem right now look at how this when I plugged ineta gives us the same thing what we started with gives us our original function back right now what's that say how is that symmetrical very good we're not going to call the x axis we're going to call it the polar axis so this is symmetric about the polar axis honestly with f if you if you do understand why guys in the middle are we okay with that one yes no or are we if if we plug in negative Theta and it works out that when we plug in negative Theta it gives us positive the same function with positive Theta back again if it gives us a same thing back again we're symmetric about the polar axis so that's what we try we plug in negative Theta hey look at that it's the same thing but with negative Theta now the question becomes is cosine of -2 th the same thing as cosine of POS It Is by our identity we know that about cosine if I plug in one Theta or a negative of that same angle I'm going to get the same thing out so we say all right well when I plugged in the negative Theta ultimately it gave us back our original function what that says is that we're symmetric about the polar axis that's that's all we're saying right now now let's try another one I want show you this one let's start from the beginning so F of theta is 2 cosine 2 thet let's now plug in Pius the I want to see if this thing is symmetric about the y- AIS only we call it the th = pi/ 2 line we's see so if I plug in that uh what's this going to look like what's going to be there two's going to be there okay two and then what definitely going to be there two still going to be there now what's going to be here oh I like how you said parentheses you see why the parentheses are so important here because if I have 2 Theta and I plug in Pi Pi minus Theta that two is going to do what distribute so this is going to become 2 cosine 2 piun - 2 thet quick head on if you're okay with that so far just some trigonometry that we're going through right now so you okay with a little substitution this just goes in place of our Theta so if I go from here to here the only thing is changing is my Theta becomes Pius Theta all right let's distribute that not a problem let's use an identity here we going to have to split this up because right now I have no idea what that thing looks like at all I don't know what to do and I don't know if it's the same as that remember I'm ultimately trying to get back to see whether it's the same as this thing or not does that make sense are you sure okay so let's use an identity maybe like the subtraction identity for for cosine of of two angles getting subtracted so what that is is two I'm going to pull that two out because we're going to have subtraction identity here we have cine 2 pi time cos 2 thetus sin 2 piun * sin of 2et okay where am I coming from am I making this up no yes just making it up randomly it's complete magic what is that it's an identity that you would use right now have you found that identity yet have you looked for it hope I have it right you might want to double check me check it out do I do you have that identity down somewhere many chap yeah a long time ago in your Tri class it's in the back of your book too so we go right well this is the way the the subtraction Iden works for Co you say cosine of this time cosine of this minus s of this time s of that that's the way it works so let's keep on going uh can you tell me how much this is the fun part because we can actually use some other identities to make parts of this just disappear how much is cosine of 2 pi yeah same thing as cosine of zero this whole thing is one I want is s of 2 pi it's the same thing as s of 0 how much is it I hope that you said zero and we're just mumbling one mistakenly uh what's 0 time anything whole thing's gone what's 1 * cosine 2 so this is 2 * cosine 2 Theta minus wait a minute did it work for us did what type of symmetry do we have symmetry cross what it's like the Y AIS but we call it the yeah = 2 so this says CET about Theta = piun / 2 yeah it's like the Y AIS it's basically the horizontal axis from here and the vertical axis from here quick show hands if you're okay with that one that was a lot more advanced than the previous ones okay these are easy when you just plug in negative Theta it's pretty easy to see that right away either you have it or you don't this takes a little bit more work because when you do Pius Theta you're going to have to have some sort of subtraction identity if you did you know I I erased it but if you did theta plus pi you're going to have some sort of addition identity depending where they have sign or they have cosine about that does that make sense to you so you're going to have to have one of these identities here not such a big deal if you know it so we distribute our two okay then we separate this by their subtraction identity cosine and cosine minus S and S hey that goes to zero not a problem that goes to one 1 * anything gives you that anything back times two we have two 2 * cosine 2 Thea and that because this is exactly what we started with says that we're symmetric about th/ 2 so far so good now we know that this is symmetric about the x axis the Y polar axis in the Y AIS the equals what that means is that we only need to go from0 to where 2 we're going to do that we're going to go from 0 to pi2 because if we do that the rest of it going to be symmetric and then symmetric we go flippy floppy make sense flippy FL got my sunscreen I got my flippy floppies on a boat no yeah why aren't we checking to see if it's symmetric for the last um last one we don't need to because if we have this and we have this it's going to take care of both of them for us so we don't need to worry about that one I'll show you why just second I do want to make sure that you are okay on the Symmetry right now are you okay with the Symmetry okay then we're going to do the same thing that I just erased over here we're going to draw our kind of a graphic organizer saying here's our Theta here's our R and finding out what that those points are uh just it's almost like a t table for these polar coordinates so we're going to plug this in I want you to understand a couple things I know I've said it already but I want you to understand it do you understand why we're only going from 0 to pi/ 2 why on sure we got symmetry here and here so we only need to go from 0 to 2 cuz symmetry will take care of all the rest of it for us so far so good now here's the interesting part you see the 2 Theta because we're going from 0 to pi/ 2 it doesn't necessarily mean that our graph is only going to be between 0 and p/ 2 our graph could be in other quadrants but we get to use that symmetry from 0 to pi/ 2 to our advantage that's kind of nice I'll show you that right now also when you're plugging in points plug in nice points for your particular equation don't be plugging in always the same points I don't want to see always Pi 4 pi over two because sometimes they going to be nice all right plug in some nice ones here I'm going show you what I'm talking about so here's our Theta here's our R how far do we need to go two two we going to start now think about what we have what we're going to have to do here is we're going to have to plug in our Theta and multiply it by two and then do cosine of it so give me a good point to plug in Z zero is great yeah I already got zero and I got pi over two okay besides those two ones Pi 4 is a good one because if I do pi over 4 * 2 that gives me Pi / 2 you would do you know what cos 2 is then that's a good point so we're going to plug in 4 give me another one pi over 6 if I did pi over 6 it's going be pi over 3 I could do that one I could also do pi over 8 maybe if I wanted to I chose pi over 8 because if I do pi over 8 2 * pi over 8 gives me pi over 4 and cosine Pi 4 I can use that as well so you can do either one of those it's fine but pick some nice points to plug in are you with me on that one yes for instance I probably wouldn't be doing things like uh probably not pi over 3 because out of that quadrant I don't want to deal with that I want to deal with something that's in this within this range okie dokie so if I did pi over 3 that would be 2 pi over 3 that's not within that's it's going to be a little weird for our graphing so pick some nice ones I'm going to pick pi over 8 I'm going to put Pick 3 let's give a try let's plug in zero um everybody do this with me so remember that r r is equal to 2 cosine of 2 Theta what that means is we're plugging in our independent variable here of our Theta we're getting out our R and that's just going to be our distance you list them out right now plug in Z what's 2 * 0 cosine of 0 is 1 2 is start at two again let's plug in pi/ 8 remember that before you do the coine you get a multiply by two in this case what's 2 * pi 8 Pi 4 okay so if I have Pi 4 what's cosine of pi 4times 2 two which is 17 about I want to make sure that you guys are okay with that are you seeing where these numbers are coming from honestly are you seeing where they're coming from okay how about Pi 4 let's do that one Pi 4 goes here what's 2 * pi 4 pi over 2 very good what's cosine of pi/ 2 0 * 2 is oh wait a minute that's weird okay this is weird check this out let's do 3 pi over 8 two time this is why our it's unavoidable right now but our graph's going to get a little funky so check it out 2 * remember 3 piun 8 what's 2 * 3 piun 8 3 piun okay 3 piun 4 3 4 is what's cosine of 3 piun 4 2 over time 2 is negative root wa < tk2 yeah lastly let's plug in P two see how this one works out for us um p over two what's 2 * pi/ 2 please oh this is weak sauce what's 2 * pi / 2 very good all right cosine of pi is 1 1 * 22 sure enough it's negative is that okay to have a negative R yes did I teach you how to graph polar coordinates with negative R yes sure he did you know that so yeah that's here's what's happening first are you guys all okay with the point so fans if you are good all right so we're PL in some Tri angles no problem just PL in r r is going to start at a length of two it's going to work itself down to zero and then is going to bounce back up and have a length of -2 if we can graph this then we can use our Symmetry and get a really nice picture out of it you guys ready for it so let's go for it how I'm going to start this one I'm going to do all these angles first so all of our like our do dotted lines so that we get our our appropriate angle relationships here so I'll have Pi 4 if you have pi over 4 pi over 8 is not one that we typically uh graph with but where would pi over 8 be in relation to Z and Pi 4 yeah that's why we're going to use this one because it was nice to graph with that's why I picked it because okay you know what P's right between that's kind of nice to have that right there that way you're not worried about well where's pi/ 6 compared to that one a little little lower than that right I okay I'm sorry a little above that be hard gra so Pi 8 and then 3 Pi 8 is right between these two are you still so far so good yes let's graph so what happens when I have an angle of zero what's my R please angle of zero R is perfect angle of pi/ 8 what's my R so when I get to Pi 8 check it out here's 0 I'm at 2 pi 8 I'm at about 1.7 < TK two so we're going to imagine it to be right here and take it up probably right about there sare < TK of two guys seeing that we have the same exact values just organized in a different way this graphic organizer just let you see what the points are this is your actual points on Polar graph you with me next up how about oh wait a minute P four so P four I get that gives me something right on the pole now look what's happening this says that my R is decreasing and decreasing to here and then decreasing very rapidly so what's going to happen is this thing is going to go boom right there okay now this is what's kind of fun at 3 8 it says when I get to 3i 8 what's my R negative does negative go here no what do you do with those negatives 180 oh that's right it's like right down here does that make sense to you cool so you're going to go all right so down this way and it's going to be looks like the same distance as this guy but just down here so < tk2 and last one if I'm at pi over two that says go to your angle pi over two hey we're right here and then make it R of what please negative2 is not up two but down two I want to make sure that you are all okay with those points before we move on any further are you is this weird a little bit kind of cool though right a little bit cool so what happens is you deal with your symmetry first after you determine that it's a polar equation or you make it a polar equation here we have it we know it's symmetrical about about the polar axis this way we know it's symmetrical about the 2 AIS the Y AIS this way we know it's this way now well if we graph from 0 to Pi 2 yeah some funky things can happen we can have some negatives uh by the way one reason why we did this and why we didn't do the the revolving around the origin is because sometimes those take care of force we don't have to worry about it so in our case we have 02 hey no problem 02 we have pi/ 8 2 we have 4 and 0 that gives our origin back we have 3K 8 O but it's negative that's 180° different and then we have pi/ 2 but it's negative 180° different so here's what this looks like says our R is decreasing really rapidly then increasing really rapidly and then increasing a little bit so we have something that looks like this like that do you guys see the picture that I'm seeing out of that I know that you literally see it but you see why we get that picture do you understand why we do this and why we don't just list out our points this gives you a look at what the r is doing it's shrinking to zero and then increasing but negatively and that's why we get that that looking graph you with me now we get to use our symmetry if we do I know that this is going to be symmetrical I know this is going to be symmetrical I know this is going to be symmetrical I know that's going to be symmetrical what we end up getting is this it's going to be kind of sloppy but uh here's two cuz I'm not the best artist in the world I wish I was but we're going to get something that looks like a almost like a clover leaf so it's going to go okay out this way and then a crap down and then out this way and then back and out this way and back looks aad horrible ruined it killed it but that's the picture it should actually all go through the origin like a pretty FL um but that's the idea if you were to do this correctly it goes here make it symmetrical here make it symmetrical here make it symmetrical there I know I just brutalized this graph but I'm wondering if you get the picture pun intended do you get the picture here the idea depends if you do if feel okay with that one man I right side people I got nothing from you guys are you all right with it all right man I wish I was a better artist really do maybe I took more time but didn't let's see what if I did that what my picture is not good either that looks at least a little bad it should look more like that still bad still bad as long as you get the idea this is the the thing that we're trying to do have I made have I made it made sense to you explain it well enough for you okay we're going to go ahead we're going to do one more our last example it's better on my paper you know what I'm going to leave this I'm going to do it over here are there any questions on this at all you understand where our points are coming from and a wire graph looks the way it does because we have our symmetry yes sir okay then then I've explain it well enough this gives us this Symmetry and so from here go boom and you can go boom so this gives us here and this this gives us here and this this one you can get here or you can flip it so it flips basically every way possible because we have symmetry on all of our axes here which is kind of cool okay last one so I want us to sketch this X2 + y^2 2 = 4 x^2 - y holy crap what what in the world is that do you know what that looks like no yeah me neither have no idea uh are you supposed to know what it looks like no cuz that's not even polar right now it it's it's in XY and you'd have a hard time even plugging in points right here wouldn't you yeah because what should you plug in do you even know the points on the graph nope don't even know them so how would we even go about graphing this we could maybe do with some symmetry you could probably get some symmetry out of this uh but it's not going to be all that easy to do I'll tell you right now that squar that squared that squared that squared it's going to be symmetric about both the X and Y AIS just by looking at it do you guys see what I'm talking about so whether they're plug in posit X or negative X I'm going to get the same thing now we're going to use that to our advantage I'm not going to show you the Symmetry right now or sorry when we convert this I'm going to tell you this is symmetric about the x- axxis and about the y- AIS do you see why not I mean yeah why is right there but like literally do you see that whether I plug in positive or negative it's going to be the same thing same output okay and we're going to see that it's going to look that's why I left this on the board it's going to look really similar to that when I convert it and we're going to have the same exact results it's going to be um x axis means polar axis Y axis means p 2 axis so it's going to be symmetric about those two axes again I'll show you that right now so number one thing uh do we have polar do we have rectangular what do we have rectangular let's convert it here's how you convert it I'm going to go fast just give you a taste this is kind of like an extra example you don't really need to see this one but I want to make I wanted to give it to you so here's what we know here's our two conversions do you remember the next One X and Y R I know there's an r in there but is X associated with s or cosine okay I'm going to kind of do the lamb bam F pants math Go real fast on this thing so you might have to slow this down a little bit to do it on your own no big deal do you see an R up here no I do right there I see an R right there do you see the r that's an R use that to your advantage don't be changing that to R cosine Theta S and R sin Theta Square it'll still work uh but it'll take you a lot longer okay so if you have an R man this is now going to be R squ squar did you get that so this is r squ and then we still have a square equals four well there's not really a good way around this so we're going to have to have R cosine th 2- R sin Theta squ well that's X that's Y no problem so we got R 2^ 2 = 4 inside here we're going to have R 2 we're going to have cosine 2us R 2 and then sin^2 if we factor out the R 2 we get R 2 2 = 4 R 2 and then we get cosine 2- sin 2 now is a time where you start using some identities as soon as you have your cosiness and your signs without any other garbage around them this is R the 4 this is 4 R 2 this right here there's an identity that puts cosine Square Theta and S Square th together it's not one A Plus would be one don't do one please this cosine 2 the that's what that is if you don't believe me you can look it up it's there now tell me something I can do with my R squs div if I divide then this takes care of two of these I get r^ 2 = 4 cosine 2 now lastly I do want to solve this for R so what am I going to doot so r equal the square root of four cosine 2 thet there's one more thing I'm going to do it happens with this Four Square Four is yeah that's what I'm looking looking for right now that's converted to a polar equation now here's the point that I was trying to make earlier this is what I really wanted you to see from here on out you guys are going to be fine because you know how to plug in points right and we can find out symmetry right okay now here here's what I was trying to to to show you from the rectangular equation did you grasp the concept that this is symmetrical about the XA uh sorry the Y AIS and the x-axis did you get that it's all being square has to be now check this out see how we have the cosine 2 Theta see we the cosine 2 Theta that one worked out to be symmetric about the polar axis and symmetric about this Thal 2 axis I'm not going to show you but do you understand that that's going to work out to be exactly the same thing it's going to be symmetric about the PO axis and it's going to be symmetrical about the pial 2 you can show it if you want to only difference is that's got a square root around it it's going to work out to be the same takes a little bit more manipulation but it's going to work out to be exactly the same sh hands feel okay this is going to be symmetric about these same two axes you okay with that one I want to show you something interesting that happens here so we're going to have symmetric about polar Anda = / 2 AES this is what gets just a little bit weird uh you know what make it Thea and R we'll do this again and R if I plug in zero check it if I plug in zero What's 2 * 0 cosine of 0un of one one * 2 so I still have two now if I plug in let's do our pi/ 8 and Pi 4 if I plug in pi 8 uh we got to go quickly we're run out of time 2 * pi 8 is pi 4 yes cosine of pi 4 square root of < tk2 over2 it's like s < TK of two < TK of the < TK of two over the < TK of two * 2 it's a little awkward to do what I want you to get out of this is it that's positive do you understand it's positive it's up here somewhere all right yes let's do PI 4 2 * p 4 I don't want to go through the I don't want to approximate just once you get you this positive and it's up there a little bit uh 2 * 4 is what cosine 2 nice it's going to be zero so far it looks really similar to the last one that we did yeah but check this out this is what's important for you if I try to plug in the next one specifically if I try to plug in 3 pi/ 8 or I try to plug in pi/ 2 I want to show you just a pi two because you can probably follow a little bit better plug in pi/ 2 what's 2 * pi/ 2 now listen carefully what's cosine of pi what's 1 IM these are undefined so I don't have this it's outside of my domain does that make sense to you so you can show that with domain you can actually find the domain start and I used to do it that way U but if you plug in the appropriate points you're going to find your domain so our graph does this we don't have some some of the Symmetry that we had in the last example so what happens here is we're just going to graph from 0 to pi/ 4 at zero we were at two at pi over 8 we're about here at p over 4 we're at zero but that's all we have to go to can I go further no it's undefined so really what this this one doesn't have the extra little Loop here which means that all I can do instead of making this part symmetrical as well it's just this part that gets symmetrical what it ends up being is like an infinity sign now I want to stop and make sure that you really do grasp what I just said so Che you okay getting out of that far yeah are you okay that when I plug in points these two things are going to give me a negative inside of my square root that's a problem that means it's undefined it's outside of my domain so I can only go from 0 4 and then I'm going to use this idea of I'm symmetric about the polar and symmetric about the p/ 2 a so hey here's 0 to Pi 4 at 0 I was at two at Pi 8 I'm at H something positive but just a little bit less than two at P four at zero now we get to use our symmetry I'm symmetry this way and then this way but I don't have up here I don't have that so I'm going to have oh almost I was so close dang it come on Leonard that's the best I can do that's it so this part gave a symmetrical here and then these two parts g a symmetrical this way show hands if that one made sense to you okay this is the idea have I explained it well enough for you guys to to get it okay so find out your symmetry plot your points to where you need it if it's undefined well you don't have to plot those points and then just use your symmetry all right we're going to do the last little topic on Section on section we're working on on finding out how to deal with these polar equations in the next section we're going to figure out the calculus of polar equations so right now last thing we got to deal with is how to find tangent lines of these things so I want you to think of this it's not exactly like parametric but it acts a lot like parametric you see here's the reason why uh by the way this says for x = r cosine Theta and Y R sin Theta that basically just means this is for use with parametric sorry with uh polar equations that that's all that means but now look at this do you see how X is defined as a function of theta and Y is defined as a function of theta there it's not X is defined as a function of Y it's not Y is defined as a function of X so really there are lot like parametric equations do you see that so if I want to find a derivative if I want to find derivative of y with respect to X because these guys are not functions of each other the formula for our derivative is going to start out really similar to our formula for parametric equations really similar CU X is defined as a function of theta Y is Define as a function of theta you you Fen the the thought process here okay so let me show you what that's going to be so remember with with parametrics we had well if we wanted to find the derivative of Dy firstly you know what I don't want you forget what this is what is a derivative what are we doing here der a slope that's right so when we're finding the derivative we're finding the slope now what's interesting is that with these polar equations they make some weird weird curves right weird shapes we're still finding the slope as it as we remember the slope that's why it's dydx it's going to be a slope in terms of rectangular idea so a rise over run idea now have you understand that that concept so that's why we're not doing well let's just find the slope with respect to this or with respect to this it's dydx because this is going to give us the actual rise of a run quick head on if you're okay with with that so now when we had parametrics we did stuff like this we did uh do you remember it how it was Dy DT over DX DT do you remember that only now we don't have a t here we have a what so instead of dydt it's really just Dy D Theta instead of DX DT is just DX D Theta so what we're going to do right now is we're going to look at how to find the derivative of Dy D Theta and DX D Theta so we're going to take this off to the side for a little bit so remember this idea this is where we're going to come back to let's find out if we want to well if we want to do dyd theta what that is going to be so notice how Dy D Theta says okay uh well that says the derivative of y with respect to Theta that's the derivative of y with respect to Theta uh do you'all see where that's coming from let's really focus up here for a second so dyd th says take the derivative of Y that is y with respect TOA now here's the deal what do we need to do with this if I want to find the derivative of this this side we're good to go what's this do for us how how would we do that tell me something that you know about R con is it a constant does r stay the same for all those functions that we drew no no R changed and it was based on the angle do you remember that how R started at two a lot of the times for us on our examples by coincidence and and it going to zero so is r a constant definitely not a constant but R also was based on Theta wasn't it for a certain angle we had a certain R right and then we change for a different angle what that means is that and you should know this because we had this the whole time R is a function of theta R is a function of theta okay now listen oh put this together with your Calculus ideas we got R * sin thet sin thet is clearly a function of theta yeah what's going on between R and S and what's R function of so we have a function of theta times a function of theta what do I need here rule we need the product rule you with me go ahead let's do the product rule together all right so our product rule says we're going to do the derivative with respect to Theta of R so derivative of the first time the second plus the first times the derivative of the second well let's think about what this is now now listen carefully because we're using like three different ideas here okay we're using the idea that it's similar to parametric because they're not defined as a function of one another we can treat them as a function of theta and that's pretty easy we're using that well R is a function of theta therefore have a product rule going on do you understand why we have a product rule going on it's function OFA time a function OFA also R is a function OFA but it's not given explicitly it doesn't say R equals this it doesn't say that so if R is a function of Thea that's not given explicitly what type of differentiation do I need to use implicit implicit differentiation which means that every time we take a derivative of R look at this look at it says hey take the derivative of R what's the derivative of r d I don't know because it's with respect to Theta not with respect to R so you don't just go oh well it's one because it's implicit it's a function of theta therefore we say well the derivative of r with respect to Theta is Dr D Theta it's exactly what that is now sin Theta it says we don't touch the second one so times sin theta plus we don't touch the first one that's R and we multiply by the derivative of now this one's easy it's it's a function of theta it even has a Theta up there D Theta so what's the derivative of s of theta sure sh hands if you okay with with that so far do you understand the idea that we had to use implicit because R is a function of theta well we're taking a derivative with with respect to Theta we have to have drv Theta do you understand the idea of the product rule here okay the next one well it says well look at that all we needed to do to find our derivative Dy DX we needed Dy D Theta we've got it this is dy D Theta I'm going to kind of do a shortcut here I'm just going to State it do you understand that you could do exactly the same thing with DX D Theta do you guys get that with DX Theta you can even do it from here you'd say derivative of the first times the second plus the first times the derivative of the second which is negative sign hence we get a minus okay I want to cck show hands if feel okay with that so far you sure sure you're sure all right let's put it together so we have this we said all right no problem uh Dy D Theta that stands for a slope just like we always think of a slope so even though we have these weird shapes that we're getting on these polar equations the slope is still the slope it's still rise over run hey look at that change in y over change in X rise over run only we don't have y as a function of X we don't have X as a function of Y we have them both as functions of theta no problem so we say well let's just do that Dy D Theta DX D Theta Dy D Theta because of our product rule because of our implicitation we get this DX D Theta same thing we get this if we create that ratio that we want Dy D Theta that's our formula for a derivative in with respect to our our polar equations have I explained this well enough for you guys to get it are you sure so I'll just write the last thing out here so Dy DX therefore is this you do Dr r d Theta you multiply by sin Theta you add R cosine Theta over Dr D Theta you get the same thing time cosine th minus r sin thet that is what we work for now again we're working towards finding our tangent lines okay so uh one part of finding tangent lines is being able to be able to find the slope because we know that where we have horizontal tangent lines I'll write this down at the very end we're not actually going to do an example with this but where we have horizontal tangent lines is where the slope is zero or where the numerator would equal zero does that make sense to you where we have vertical tangent lines is where we're undefined where the denominator would equal zero you with me okay so we're going to talk about that in just a little bit but our first step is actually finding the slope so let's go ahead let's do one quick example I'm going to give you a polar equation here r equal that you know what just out of curiosity does anybody remember what that shape is it's cardio that's a cardioid that's right that's the cardioid remember that one the but know I shouldn't have said that it's not the buid yeah it's the cardioid and it's this way it's to the side um 1 plus sin Theta is a cardioid but upward so it's very similar just in a different direction okay so that's a cardioid I want to find the derivative and I want to find the slope of the tangent line at a certain point so here's how it might be worded find dydx and the slope of the tangent line at Theta = 6 okay let's do it if you look back at this check this out look I want to show this to you before we actually get right into our example what you need to know in order to do your derivative is pretty straightforward it says can you find Dr D Theta yes here's R could you take a derivative of this that's Dr D Theta so Dr D Theta is just a derivative of this with respect to Theta you get me so you find that first let's do that first so Dr D Theta equals what's the derivative of one what's the derivative of cosine Theta so the derivative of r with respect to Theta is negativea show feel okay with that so far so here's what's going to happen when we do our ratio we're going to have that thing sin Theta here and we're going to have it here are you with me sin Theta that's not going to change cosine Theta that's not going to change the plus doesn't change the minus doesn't change this cosine doesn't change that sign doesn't change but the r is an issue so the r how much is R do you know how much R is right there you're just going to plug that in so what we do is we plug in we do the this little derivative first it's usually pretty easy do this derivative we're going to put it here over here and here sin Theta cosine theta plus minus cosine Theta sin Theta and then we're going to in input whatever our R is into our formula why don't you guys go ahead and try to do that on your own just create our Dy D Theta right or Dy DX right now I would do on the board we'll see if we come with the same thing put we have over the same thing put our then we do r just testing you now I have a test for you guys for those of you who like to make me want to drink at night uh can I simplify these can I simplify these don't ever freaking do that okay ever ever ever unless your pluses and minuses are in parenthesis you can't simplify anything if they're in parentheses it means you you're multiplying by everything all your factors okay so we can't we can't touch a thing let's see if we got it right uh we have our Dr D Theta here and here we got our sign we got our cosine we got our plus we got our minus we got our R here and here then we got our cosine we got our sign did you get the same thing that I got yes now you could what what is this what do we have right here what does this mean what is it what did you just find the derivative derivative stands for slope that's it that's what it is this represents the slope of that cardio remember the cardioid was the cardioid well this represents a slope of that shape at any point that you give it but our points are now angles so you say at angle of zero what is it well it's probably going to be undefined it's probably going to be a vertical tangent at pi/ 6 what is it I don't know probably going to be negative probably just just a hunts because we go like that cardioid looks like that make sense go at this angle what we can find out what the slope is at any point any angle along that coding that's really actually interesting so don't forget what we're doing we're finding the slope of things that's what a derivative is so since we find dydx all you have to do just plug in five or six now it's probably going to be a little bit nicer if you make if you simplify this a little bit because I don't want to have to plug it in 1 2 3 4 5 six I don't have to plug it in eight times okay so maybe work with it just as a little bit of exercise right now we're going to work through this thing and and simplify this so if we were to do that could you plug it in yes would it be a little bit easier to find horizontal and vertical tangents if you simplified it oh yeah so we're going to have sin^2 th we're going to have plus cosine theta plus cosine 2 thet we're just going to distribute some things we're going to have sin Theta cosine Theta minus sin thetus sin sin Theta cosine Theta can y'all check my algebra too make sure I'm doing that right would you double check me please s squ you distribute Bam Bam we get this distribute get this or multiply distribute we get that with me so far let going start reorganizing some things here because we're going to see some identities pop out of this so first identity that we see what I'm looking for are things like cosine squ plus sin square or cosine squ minus sin squ don't use the wrong identity I'm looking for common terms or like terms you guys okay with that so far yes no yes okay we'll continue does anybody oh man I hope that you know anybody know what cosine squ th minus sin is and don't you dare tell me one cosine 2 that's right that's right this thing right here this piece is cosine 2 I know that's too small to see probably but it's cosine 2 plus cosine th another question can I add cosine 2 th plus cosine thet cosine 3 thet you passed very good you just passed trigonometry okay uh next one how about this how about ignore the negative for a second just look at 2 sin Theta cosine Theta there's another identity right there that's sin 2 right so we're going to have this piece right here sin 2 thetus s so far so good let's do one more thing just to make it a little bit nicer if you want to you can do this let's factor out this negative that way we don't have to worry about subtraction on our denominator here so the way I would probably write this I'd write this as negative cosine 2 thet plus cosine Theta over sin 2 thet plus sin Theta that is our derivative okay I want show show hands if you okay with with that one so far okay now we've answered part of our question so far we've answered this part find dydx we've just found it again I'm going to keep on saying this what is what is this that's the slope what's this what's it the slope of uh to what you're right slope of the tangent line to what to that yeah whatever shape that is that happens to be a cardioid so this says you know what what's also interesting it's the slope based on the angle so that's why I'm giving you I'm not giving you X I'm not giving you y these are polar so it says Hey U tell me what the slope is of your function or the slope of the tangent line to your your function at a certain angle so at Pi 6 so it says okay start at zero go to pi/ 6 tell me what the slope is uh well can you do it M what are you going to do to find out what my slope is plug it in go for it there's four places to plug it in so plug in pi 6 here here here here do not neglect that that is a negative plug in P six here here here here let's figure that out I'm going to expect that you can do it on your own so Dy DX X evaluated ateta = / 6 or in other words M the slope of our tangent line evaluated pi over 6 really did run out of room didn't I sure Ro smaller I'm going to do most of it in my head so if we plug in pi/ 6 here what's 2 * piun 6 what's cosine of pi 3 it's 12 did you did you remember your negative yes 12 plus what's cosine of < / 6 okay keep going U remember we're plugging in pi 6 that's why we're evaluating this plug in what's 2 * 6 what's s of 3 you're going to see why we factor out the negative in just a hot second uh what's s of pi over 6 what is that now you don't need to go further than this and here's why you have 12 plus ro32 you have 2 +2 what is that that's one that's actually it's negative 1 didn't we talk listen didn't we talk about the cardio would shaped like cardio would shaped like this you have this heart shape on its side and we said that at high six so it's kind of like this kind of like that here's zero at pi/ 6 you're about right there what we're finding is a slope at that Point what's the slope going to be should be negative because at Pi 6 our tangent Line's going like that it turns out our slope is negative it's just 1 so what we found and which is really kind of cool we found the slope of a polar equation a polar graph at a certain angle so F if you understand the the concept here it's a really cool idea now I'm just going to wrap this thing up here real quick I'm going to write right down here if you wanted to find horizontal tangents I mentioned it earlier but I'll state it for the record horizontal tangents are going to happen where the top of your derivative your numerator your main numerator where the main numerator of your derivative is equal to zero vertical tangents happen where your derivative is undefined or where the main denominator of your derivative is equal to zero so in other words look it the main numerator is just Dy thet the main denominator is just DX D Theta so if you want to find horizontal tangents what would we set equal to zero yeah we' set the top so for horizontal tangents we just do Dy D Theta equal Z for vertical tangents we do DX D Theta and that's going to give you the angle the angle the Theta at which you are going to have either vertical or horizontal tangents have I explained this well enough for you it it's very similar to parametric if you think back to parametric do you remember that we had dxdt for for vertical we had dydt for horizontal and now our our T is really just a a Theta so far so good okay we just finished section 10 point whatever WR the next thing that we're going to do we're going to talk about using these polar equations in calculus so finding out the are we we kind of did that here but we're going to find out the area under a curve or between of our curve contained within it and that's going to be kind of interesting so we're going to start that right 80 last minute questions on this St okay all that to find one all that to find negative one that's right well that's just like when did all that work to find was Divergent good point like man you show nothing
