Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.5:  Calculus of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
all right so our lesson today is going to be on inverse trig functions we're going to learn how to take derivatives take integrals but first we're going to study just what these things mean what they look like what the the functions graph as why we can even do it what the domain is what the range is we're going to start with just the idea of what a trig function is now I want you to think about what it means to be an inverse compared to a function there was one qualification that we had to have in order to guarantee that we actually could find it inverse a function had to be this in order to have a inverse what 1 one it's got to be 1: one now I want you to think of trig functions all the ones that you know are trig functions one: one is tangent considered one well tangent does this but then over here does this do you have to restrict the domain that's right what about sign is sign one to one from Z to Pi heck no it does this all all the time right and so do cosine but if we do restrict the domain then we can change these functions into something that can have an inverse so if we think about trick function General no they're not one: one but if we restrict the domain then we make them we kind of force them to be one to one for a little area which means that our inverses of trig functions are going to have very specific domains does that make sense to you so we're going to talk about inverses of trig functions but only on certain domains not for the whole thing because you can't do that then it would not be the inverse would actually be a function so so we need a restrict domain then we can have inverse trat functions let me give you an example here real quick so if we look at y = sin x will if you remember what y sinx looks like does this one start at zero or start at one so this looks okay here's one and negative one where's it Peak do you remember and our function goes up Peaks hit zero at Pi goes down bottoms out hit Z at 2 pi so we get the this that looking graph obviously that hopefully to you is not one to one it does not pass the horizontal line test in fact no portion of this unless we go from here to here is actually one: one we don't want to consider that so we're going to take this function and even go a little bit left with it so if we go left a little bit say/ 2 what's uh what's S of/ 2 yeah that would be down here the idea is let's not consider sign for the entire domain because obviously it's not 1: one and in order to find an inverse we have to have a function that is 1: one so what we've done to make the these things easier not have a a domain that's way over here to have a domain that's kind of nice for us to work with that has a zero in it because we like to have domains with zeros in it's really nice we says no we're not going to consider from here to here cuz that's obviously not 1: one from here to here is 1: one but it's it's not a nice domain that we like to work with P that it's not one to one anyway but right here between 2 and pi/ 2 we're going to eliminate all this other stuff and focus on this domain so if we focus on the domain and restrict it toga Pi / 2 to Pi / 2 do you guys see that s becomes one one: one on that domain yes no okay good so yal sinx cool on the domain of Pi / 2 to Pi 2 is 1 to one and that's what we want again if a function is 1 to one it must have an inverse therefore we say okay cool we can find an inverse on this domain and what I'm going to do is uh I'm going to rewrite this just a little bit I'm going to get rid of all this stuff if sign is one to one on that domain then we can find an inverse for it and what we're going to do is for the rest of this our time in uh in this little subsection here I'm going to give you an original function trig function we're going to talk about the inverse so what the domain is what the range is and then what the inverse is domain and range is you guys ready for it so with sign what's the domain again cool that's right do you remember what the difference between brackets and parentheses are brackets include it include it and the parentheses don't include it so domain is this range I'm sorry what was the range one more time perfect oops I just went over that too huh brackets includes it now if we talk about the inverse remember what inverse does what an inverse does is it switches the X and the Y it switches the domain with the range so a couple notes that that we have um just a few of them so a little bit of a note here first one we're going to use this in a little bit not right now but in a little bit why = sin inverse of x if and only if s of y equal x that's the only that's the only only way we can have this so inverse functions work where we switch our X into y so y sin inverse of x if and only if s of yal X also couple other things inputs get interchanged with outputs which means that domain gets interchanged with range so if this is our sign y = sin x then we should be able to find and inverse for it let's talk about it you make that a little bigger so we can see it better okay so uh a couple important things again since this is one: one we have to find an inverse since we know about inverses already there Reflections across the diagonal y equal x what that means is that our our inputs change with our outputs our X's become y's our y's become X's so let's look at this from our domain and range and see what we can get for our picture over here from our points see we for our picture over here so if the point Pi / 2 1 if the point P / 2 1 is on my original graph the point 1 Pi / 2 will be on my inverse graph does that make sense Pi 2 1's on this one therefore 1 comma Pi / 2 is here does that make sense to you ifunk /21 is on my original graph on the inverse I should have 1 commk / 2 if 0 0 is on my original graph 0 0 is also going to be on my inverse now right now it looks almost the same but the curve the curve is switched notice if I reflect this it's not going to be doing this anymore it's going to be doing this it's not going to be doing this anymore it's going to be doing this and that's the way this inverse sign looks so our inverse sign function looks like that about like that I'm not the best artist in the world but hopefully you get the picture here uh show pans feel okay with with that one so with our inverses we can find them just from our original functions by interchanging our x's and our y's now also let's talk about the domain and the range of these this is going to be important for you you do have to consider the domain and the range of your functions and your inverse trig function so tell me something about the domain what's the domain of our inverse sign or sign inverse perfect so with sin inverse we're not talking about plugging in pi that's out of the domain we can only plug in from1 to one do you understand look it if you can only get out think about sign when you plug in anything to sign all you can get out is between 1 and 1 right if range becomes domain that means for inverses you can only plug in1 to one you can't plug in anything bigger than that or smaller than1 you guys getting the idea here so our domain is for sure1 to one how about the range that's right basically these just switch now we're going to use the same idea we're going to go a little bit quicker through this since I've already explained the idea of being 1: one we're going to define a section of a trig function that is 1: one and we're going to start switching around the X and the Y then we're going to switch the domain with the range and get the domain and range of our inverse functions are you guys okay with this one before we go on yes okay let's let's keep going then um how about cosine where's cosine start okay so if we went any further this way we'd have something that's not one to one so we're going to start this domain of cosine at zero so domain normally does this we don't want [Applause] that so we're going to ignore everything but the range from zero [Music] to what's that one good what's this one so we want Z to Pi so we don't care about this we don't care about this firstly did we Define a section of our graph that is one: one okay yes yes okay tell me the domain that we're going to be working with for our our cosine zero pi and the range of this little one: one section is good this is still 1 this is still one so1 to one quick head not if you're okay with that one so far that's just your regular coine now let's make it inverse because it's one: one we know that we can do this so let's see if we can do it um tell you what if the1 is on my original function if 0 1's on my original what's on my inverse perfect that's there if pi1 is on my function what's on my inverse if one Z is on my function and we get something looks like this wow that's really nasty sorry I hope you get the idea of it my graphs are not that great oh you know what um that's why that's Mr Leonard being I made a mistake here did you catch my mistake I hope that you did I I made a mistake here I said something wrong I want you to catch it I said 01 is on this graph is z I'm sorry 1 Z is one Z on that graph no what is that actually probably would have made it better if I would have put pi over two yeah so which is why I got a funny graph over here if Pi / 2 Zer on my graph then 0 Pi / 2 remember this is pi and this is right between Pi / 2 that looks a little bit better my mistake on that let's talk about domain and range what's our new domain for inverse function how about a range 0 to five these two just switch we still okay with these ones okay we got several more to do so we're going to kind of kick it up a little bit let's talk about uh tangent now naturally tangent does this repeating thing right it's those S curves that repeat over and over and over again so hopefully for you it makes sense that we're going to Define this between / 2 where we have an Asm toote to P over two tangent looks about like that now since this is one to one on that domain our domain isun 2 to Pi 2 someone out there tell me should I use brackets for this or parentheses for that okay cuz I can't actually get there now our range our range is interesting it's a little bit different from before what's our range [Music] that's right goes it's so negative Infinity to Infinity which means for our inverse we can find it is 1: one here's what happens with this of course 0 0 hopefully see this 0 0 is on original 0 0 is going to be on the inverse if I have ASM tootes at X = PK / 2 and x = / 2 on the inverse I'm going to have ASM tootes at y = piun / 2 and Y = piun 2 does that make sense to you so this graph is going to be reflected that includes our ASM tootes so here's / 2un / 2 now what this one says is that as we approach x = < / 2 we approach y = positive Infinity did you see that that means as we get y closer to p 2 x is going to approach positive Infinity so we have this look and that's our inverse function for for tangent okay quick so hands feel okay with these ones so far do you have this written down because I got to erase it but we are going to reference this so keep in mind the the domains of these things okay I'm going to be referencing the domains of s and the domains of sin inverse a lot and so same thing with cosine and tangent I'm going to try to fit the three remaining ones over here so we can use them um but keep these things in mind okay what's the next one we got what do you want to do yeah we can do cosecant we start with sign may as well do [Applause] cosecant if you forgotten how cosecant looks it's those ones with the U's that's like if you took a took sign and exploded it and so instead of doing this it does this so it has these 's everywhere here's how it looks we have 1 And1 so we're still touching that but we're not between 1 Anda 1 we're outside of it we got Pi / 2 we got / 2 and they look like this now are those one to one no not even close so if they're not one to one we got to erase them with this graph what we're going to choose to do is we're going to keep our domain as simple as possible our domain is going to stick right here we're going to erase this and that so really what we're looking at is just this piece of the graph this piece and this piece that's going to be the domain that we restrict for cosecant because otherwise we don't have a one: one function you guys all right with this so far now let's look at what the domain of this thing actually is our domain what is our domain what can we plug into this all plug in between okay we start at over 2 you guys see that right Zer okay so piun / 2 can we actually plug in PK 2 can we plug it in yes there's a point there where do we go to Z can we actually plug in zero no that's a problem so we're going to go to zero we're going to put a little parentheses there saying I can't plug in zero do you guys see why we can't plug in zero we have an ASM toote here and here we can't plug plug that in but we can start just on the other side of zero and go to where oops and we can actually get P two so we can basically plug in anything between piun / 2 and Pi / 2 except for what number yeah that's the idea now let's talk about the range I'll give you negative Infinity I like the negative infinity negative Infinity up to where do we stop one can we actually get the negative one yes now is there anything between negative 1 and one no so we got to pick this thing back up again at one and go to positive Infinity what that means for our inverse is that our domain and range are going to switch so when we do y = cose inverse it's a little weird to think about but here we go we'll start off kind of Simply I'm going to eras these because those are Irrelevant for us if we have pi over 2 1 on this graph then 1 piun / 2 is going to be on this graph if we havek 2 1 then we're going to get1 negative / 2 here we okay with that we sure as we get closer to zero we're going to positive Infinity on the Y so as we get closer to zero we're going to go positive Infinity on the X and likewise here and that's a look for cosecant inverse tell me what the domain is please domain should be pretty easy for you guys what's the domain for our cose inverse say what here well yeah the domain is actually a little bit easier to see for me Infinity 1 inclusive one to Infinity in fact it should be exactly this our range should be exactly this and hopefully you can see that it is are you guys okay with that one it's a little weird right well it was for me the first time I saw it years and years ago but are you okay with that one so we know that hey Pi / 2 1 no no no 1 pi/ 2K 2 1 no 1K 2 Infinity at positive y's Infinity at positive X's that's the idea I think I'm going to run out of room here on this next one I'll have to do the other one over here so let's do what am I missing I got a s cosine tangent Co let's do co uh let's do see secant looks really really similar to cosecant it's only shifted over just like cosine looks really similar sign it's only shift it over so when we shift this over what we actually get is at one negative 1 this looks like that and this that's how secant looks graphically we see that at zero we got one at Pi we got negative 1 can we plug in Pi / 2 no remember that secant is one over cosine and if you plug in pi cosine you get zero and so if we do that we'd have something that's undefined that's where these as toes are actually coming from is the one over zeros that we have so is this one: one right now no let's erase this and this and then we do have something that's one to one from this little piece will erase this whole side and this little piece erase this whole side can you tell me what the domain is [Music] talking about the domain the domain we can plug in zero that's good yeah we can plug in zero and you can plug it in where does it go to can you plug in p/ two okay so no but then we start up at pi over 2 again and we end up getting to or Pi Pi that's right and we can actually plug in pi how about the rain oh let's do the rain what can you get out of this thing number and that's right so any number between there saysa Infinity to 1 inclusive and then 1 to positive Infinity so now we get to go ahead and do the inverse here we go if 01 is on our original graph then 1 Z is on my new graph let's see if pi1 is on my original graph then -1 Pi is on my inverse graph if we did a horizontal ASM toote sorry a vertical ASM toote of Pi 2 we're going to have a horizontal one at pi/ 2 for inverse as we went positive along the Y we were ASM totic to pi/ 2 so as we go horizontal along the X we're going to be ASM totic and same thing here make sure I get all these things right let's see our domain and a range what's our domain for this next one yeah look at this infity to 1 and then one to Infinity range should be exactly like this domain and we've got one more that you guys have questions on these two do you have these written down especially the domain in the range yes m okay coent coent if you'll remember looks like a shifted over and inverted tangent so it still has an ASM toote at Z and at Pi it only looks like this though like that where our domain is 0 to Pi but not inclusive and a range is what please so with our cotangent inverse if we have ASM tootes vertical ASM tootes at 0 and Pi we got horizontal ASM tootes at 0 and Pi if Pi / 2 0 is on our graph then 0 pi2 on our [Applause] inverse let's see Pi we're doing netive Infinity so Pi we're doing negative Infinity here and that's the graph sorry about the bad graph on that one but that's the graph for our cotangent inverse and we'll do the domain and range and be done with this stuff gets pretty Dy pretty fast domain is negative Infinity to infinity and then range is 0 to Pi oh my gosh thank goodness we're finally done with those things U what I want to know out of this is do you understand where the inverses are coming from did you see the the development of those I don't want to just give you the inverse say this is what it looks like but hopefully you've seen the relationship do you guys see the relationship x's and y's are just changing domains and rs are just changing that's the whole idea here now what we're going to do just to get our heads wrapped around this is practice a few examples of using some inverses seeing what it looks like so we're going to evaluate evaluate just means uh find out the answer what I'm of this expression I'm giving you so let's look at this one I want to find out what sin inverse of 12 is sin inverse of/ 12 equals y how much is y think about what inverses are in relationship to their original trink functions and this will help you a lot so think about it this way sin inverse of 12 = y if and only if s of y equals 12 do you see how to change between an inverse and the original you just switch your Y and your in your output your input your domain and your range your X and your y so if sin inverse of/ 12 equals y well then sin y has to equal 1/2 are you guys okay on that switch then you think in your head or you use your unit circle and you think okay well well uh what angle do I have to plug in here to give me a sign of 1/2 keep in mind what's the domain what's the domain of your sign that we've restricted it to look at your domain right now for sign what's the domain of the sign okay so whatever you find it's got to be between pk/ 2 and Pi 2 so we restricted to the fourth and first quadrants does that make sense to you so just look there look on your unit circle and figure out okay what is it six five or six five or six what that means for us is that sin inverse of 12 equals / 6 notice this the range the range of sign inverse wask / 2un 2 because the domain we restricted for sign wask 2K / 2 is this in the domain I'm sorry in the range of sin inverse is it between pi/ 2 and Pi / 2 okay so that's that's one key I want you to understand is that this had to be the appropriate range of sign inverse and domain of sign because they're the same thing it's got to be in the range of sin inverse and the domain of sign they're the same in this Cask 2 Tok / 2 since it is we know that we've done this one right are you guys okay with that one so far are you sure are there any questions on that I want to make sure yall get it before we go on having fun yet we're not really even doing calculus huh just doing tree right now don't worry we'll get to Cal soon enough uh how about cosine in inverse of this so cosine inverse of < TK 32 = y remember this is if and only if can you restate that on your own if I say cosine inverse ofk 3 2 = y can you tell me what the original the the inverse of that would be cosine of perfect now now look at your papers look at notes here and tell me what is the range of cosine inverse or likewise same thing what's the domain of cosine 0 to Pi so whatever you find here whatever this is it has to be between Z and Pi that means you restrict your unit circle to the first two quadrants remember that all students all things are positive only sign is positive so cosine this is probably going to be in the second quadrant because we have something oh shoot you know what I forgot the negative uh let's make that negative all right that's for funsies okay so if we you know what we'll do both if I didn't have the negative what quadrant would it be okay if I do have the negative what quadrant is it okay we just learned something so because this is negative > 3 over2 I'm not thinking first quadrant I'm thinking second quadrant I'm not thinking any other ones because that's outside of the domain of this I'm thinking only 0 to Pi have you thought about how much that is remember that cosine counts up so cosine counts up uh of 4 over two 3 two of two over two of 1 over two and then of 0 over two then it counts back down > 1 over two of two over two 3 over two of 4 over two so NE but negative so this one would be exactly right so if we find out that Y is 5K 6 then we we've solved our problem then we know that cosine inverse of > 32 is 5 6 that's the idea here are we okay with the idea so far I know that some of you don't like trig so much are you understanding this part of it yeah your unit circle is going to be pretty important right okay tan inverse < TK 3 = y t inverse < tk3 = y this happens if and only if tan y = < TK 3 can you please give me the restricted domain of our tangent very good restricted domains 2 to two that means that whatever we find has to be in the fourth or first quadrants are you with me on that one fourth or fourth or first quadrants all students take okay so force forc or first over anyway so the right side of the circle yeah that's right it's the right side so can you think of uh all students take calculus tangent is positive in the 1 and negative in the fourth we're looking at positive angles here so this has to be in quadrant number one can you think of what gives you tangent 3 5 3 yeah yes so then y equals 3 that means that tan inverse of the < TK 3 = P3 that's the way we look at these things we first find out okay well translate this back into its original function rather than inverse look at the original functions we're better at that we have unit circles that help us with that then we think about in in the domain that we we've restricted what's the appropriate angle that's going to give us this relationship find out that appropriate angle make sure that it is actually the the correct quadrant and then we just restate it sin inverse of2 is 5 or six and so on and so forth so if F feel okay with this so far now if you ever come across something like this cosine inverse of 6 I don't have anything on my unit circle that says 6 okay so what I'm going to do with this I'm going to use my calculator so when you get something like this just use your calculator you have the cosine inverse on your calculator make sure it's in radians please make sure it's in radians and then just do that don't don't do it now just try it on your own later just use your calculator so these ones I don't want you using your calculator here I don't want to get random weird decimal numbers I want you to really work on it if it's a number like2 32 of 3 those ones that you you see on the unit circle do it this way if it's 6 234 use your calculator the this am I getting three of you guys on that one so try doing this if you can't do it then use your calculator okay now we're going to continue here now what we're going to try is compounding some of these trigonometric relationships they get a little funky but I'm going give you two ways to work on it both of them are really good ways so I'll show you right now [Applause] what if I asked you to find tangent of cosine inverse of 12 and you go please no I don't want to do that pull the inside out you can you actually this one's kind of easy really when you think about this one's easy I'm going to give you two ways to do it if it's an easy number like2 a number that appears on your unit circle you can do it this way think about what cosine inverse is so cosine inverse cosine inverse of 12 would equal let's call it Theta that means that cosine Theta would have to equal one are you guys okay with that change do you see what I'm talking about here if cosine inverse of 1 have Theta Call Ita then cosine Theta would equal 12 you you switch the X and the Y tell me what angle gives you 1 12 when you put it into cosine pi over 3 so then Theta would equal pi over three are we okay with that one you sure well look at that this is what we called Theta so we know that cine inverse 12 = < 3 that that's what we know this sorry is what you put in here can you find tangent of Pi 3 can you do that how much is tent of Pi 3 just Square three did that did I blow your minds with that one I don't want to blow your minds but really what we're doing huh we did that in trig yeah you did this in trig I just want to make sure you can still do it now that you're not in trig can you still do it now that you're not in trig okay so we take the the inside cosine inverse of 1/2 no problem this is pi 3 just plug in the pi 3 to tangent you getun of three does that make sense there is another way to look at this when these get harder you can do it this way from right here you go okay tell you what let's consider coine = 12 draw yourself a triangle that has the relationship OFA of cosine Theta so here's our Theta if cosine theta equals 12 please tell me the the side relationship of right triangle for cosine it is what over what very good adjacent over adjacent over hypotenuse we okay with that one find the missing side can you find the missing side sure so how much is it this would be the sare < TK of 2 2 - 1 2 3 Now now find the trigonometric relationship that you're looking for trig function that you're looking for so if we know that this is cosine thet just find tangent of that so tangent Thea would equal tangent is opposite over adjacent < TK 3 1 or simply < 3 so there's really two ways to do it you can do it just directly with it or you can make a triangle out of it if you make a triangle take this relation Shi take the inside here's the steps take the inside find the original trig function WR drw yourself triangle whatever you get out of that triangle find the trig function of this new triangle of that angle and that's very easy do you guys want to try one more yes I'll show you one that you can't do the other way that you have to use a triangle so what's the first thing we want to do the let's take the inside let's do sin inverse of 1/3 what are we going to call that let's Call Ita yeah let's call that Theta so look what we're doing look look at the word this piece right now is Theta does that make sense to you so when we draw a triangle that Theta is the same Theta so if I'm trying to find of this that's just find of that triangle you're you're good to go relating to the Theta the angle that you called it does that make sense so okay so sin inverse of 1/3 equal if and only if sin Theta = 13 just switch them you okay with that so far now there's nothing on my unit circle that has a 1/3 this is going to take a triangle sign give me the relationship for sign what two sides do opposite hypotenuse usually you'll have to find the other one so let's find the other one here uh okay that would be the square root of that one no what one two three that one do you guys know how to use pyan theorem Square this one square this one one subtract them put square root around it there you go you got it this is it two2 now find Cent OFA OFA look at this of theta isent of this thing it's the same thing so this is Theta this is Theta so just find of thent now if tangent is opposite over adjacent Cent is it's the reciprocal so we're going to get what that means for us is that coent of sin inverse of 1/3 is 2 < tk2 that's what we're required to find in this problem is there ever going to be any domain restrictions though when we start doing this you do have to make sure these fit the domain now of course this is within this is within our domain for sin inverse between sure if it's not then you can't do it uh you know what that's not completely I'll show you one that that we we fail the domain I'll show you how to work with it um actually right now so a couple properties of inverses that we have are these for these are all true if the domains are correct so what we're looking at right here the X has to be in this domain so this is only true if x is between -1 and 1 because that's the domain that's the domain of sin inverse are you guys follow me on this on this that's like a function this has the domain of this correct so then in order for this to actually work this x would have to be in the appropriate domain if it's not then we got an issue this works if it's in the appropriate domain again same1 to one this works if it's in the appropriate domain domain for Tan inverse Wasa Infinity to Infinity do you remember these domains from the inverses that we just did Sin inverse had this domain cosine inverse had the same domain tan inverse has this domain now check this out please look when we switch them around the domain changes so it depends on what is inside and what is outside yes it's true that whenever you have a a trig function next to its inverse or you compose them basically a trig function with its inverse a trig function onto its inverse whenever you do that yeah it's it's it's undoing it that's what inverses do they undo each other so we're going to get x x x x x provided that this is the argument of your inside function is in the domain of the inside function so for instance this has to be in the domain of sin inverse in the domain of this in the domain of this this would have to be in the domain of sign that we restricted this is no longer - 1 to 1 it's actually piun / 2 to piun / 2 this is no longer 1 to1 it's actually zero to Pi this is no longer negative Infinity to Infinity it's piun / 2 to Pi 2 I'll give you uh just two very very quick examples about how you would do this watch carefully if I wanted s sin inverse of3 here's how you do it you look here is this in the appropriate domain for for instance this is sin inverse so is 3 between1 and 1 then this problem is really easy if this is within this domain you oh cool the answer is3 zero work a trig function will undo its respective inverse that is what will happen provided that is in the domain so if that's between -1 and one for my inverse function Booyah we're done what happens sometimes though is you get this now we can work with it you just got to work around it so check this out cosine inverse of cosine 3i / 2 two things about it firstly look at cosine 3i / 2 is this in the appropriate domain no no so you cannot do this this does not equal 3 2 it's not true here's what you do you think about how much cosine 3i 2 actually is how much is cosine of 3i 2 Z it's zero then if you change this to what it actually is cosine inverse of 0 cosine inverse of well okay that's between there that's fine we can actually do that so cosine inverse of 0 what do you need what angle do you need to get zero out of your cosine think about it this way if you need to cosine thet = 0 between uh sorry coine between Z and Pi cosine of what gives you zero please this so it's not 3i / 2 it's actually two so sometimes even if it's not in the appropri domain you change this one you look at what it actually is this really is zero then do cosine inverse of zero that'll be in your domain and then you can work with it so P feel okay with with that part okay cool Okay so we've learned a lot about inverse trig functions already we learned some a few identities how to work with them a little bit what the angles mean in reference to our original trig functions now we're going to move over to derivatives and in just a little bit we're going to talk about integrals that involve some of these inverse functions also if you ever read or hear arc sign or Arc cosine that's what these mean as well they're inverses as well so here's our derivatives now they look a little weird uh why why in the world do these deres look the way they do I'm going to put them up on the board and at first you might be kind of curious is where they come from I'll prove a couple just two of them for you to show you where these are actually coming from so here's our derivatives this is another thing that you're going to want to write down uh like on your your paper to have next to you when you're doing your homework um I I'll talk a little bit later about about our tests in this class but write these down and have these next to you okay we're going to need these so here we go so s inverse our derivative if you want to do the derivative of s inverse it really doesn't look like cosine or anything that's not the way these inverses work the Der of s inverse is actually oh you know what can you do me a favor because a lot of these are going to involve the chain rule instead of X what are we going to use yeah let's use U after I have you writing them all down sorry change them all to youu so if we want to do the the uh the derivative of the sin inverse of U of course we still need to do our chain rule but here's how we do it we put 1 over theare < TK 1 - u^2 and then if we have the chain rule that's when we apply it one over the < TK of 1 - U ^2 DX for cosine now do you remember this you remember how um derivative of s is positive and derivative of cosine is negative same thing works here it's going to look identical it's just that it's negative isn't that interesting so lot of the saying properties it just it looks really weird so we'll have 1/ < TK 1 - U ^ 2 * DX but it's going to be negative tangent tan inverse we have 1 over 1 + u^2 or you could do u^2 + 1 due to the commutativity of addition DX cosecant for cose we have -1 absolute value U sare < TK u^ 2 -1 D DX now s is really related to cosecant cosine really related to secant if s was positive and cosine was negative tell me the relationship between cosecant and secant did you follow that these two are really related right so are these two these two are related so are these two so this is positive versus negative this is negative versus that's right it's going to look exactly the same just with the positive and lastly we got coent notice that coent is going to be really similar to tangent it's just the same thing only negative and those are our derivatives do you see why I say uh put these on a piece of paper have them next to you when you're doing these because they're going to be hard to memorize right off the bat and they're really similar to each other so have these down whenever you see a derivative of s u or S sin inverse U I'm sorry I misspoke sin inverse U sin inverse of 3x or something we can use this just have that formula plug in U where it's supposed to go we're going to do a couple examples right now well in a couple minutes I want to prove a couple of these uh but are you okay with the formulas right there do you have written down exactly the way I have them written down yes sir you'll make sure they're all exactly correct cuz we don't want to mess up any of these signs like1 versus positive one or have anything transposed now would you like to see why these are the way they are okay let me do a proof uh we'll prove this one and this one the others are are similar so proof of we'll do the cosine inverse well let's start off with what what cosine inverse of we'll do X but if we have cosine inverse of x equals y this happens if and only if we did this last time this happens if and only if cosine of y equal x do you remember doing that yes okay well if I've considered cosine y x these two things are they basically say the same same thing okay the one's just the inverse of the other so let's work on this one this is going to be a little bit easier for us let's take the derivative on both sides notice that this is in implicitly defined it's implicitly defined because I have y wrapped up in a function equal to X so let's do some implicit differentiation with it if I take the derivative of both sides y'all can help me with this side what's the derivative of x one perfect and the derivative of cosine y keep in mind this is implicit so Y is a function of X what would we have to do if Y is a function of X here y okay so negative sign you guys okay with the negative sin x der of cosine is not X but y y very good dydx because of whatc implicit which really that just means a change rule uh we'd have a derivative of y with respect to X because Y is a function of X that's not explicitly defined here we okay with that one well this is really easy let's just solve for this let's solve for dydx if we solve for dydx we got 1/ sin y by show hands feel okay with that so far okay now does this look anything like this yeah well we could do the negative right we can move the negative here does that look anything like that here's the problem sin y it's still not explicitly defined it's still implicit so what we want to do is we want to figure out how much sin y really is equivalent to uh so we're going to do this one of two ways we're either going to use an identity which is the way I'm going to show you or you can even use a triangle for this which is the way I'm going to show you in the next uh next process so I'm going to do two different processes on these proofs one using identity one using a triangle and show you each way notice that either of them can be done in either way so in our case we could be making a triangle right now like I'm going to do the next one but I'm going to use a really simple identity that we really should have down we should know that if I do sin y^ 2 + cosine y^ 2 it's supposed to be equal to how much that's a Pythagorean identity well tell you what Let's uh let's solve for y here if I subtract cosine S I get sin^2 y = 1 - cosine squ y you guys okay with that one we're almost there let's take a square root now here's the fun part here's the interesting part first are you guys okay on working down this this this identity okay fantastic now cosine Y how much is cosine let's look back up here how much is cosine y do you see it so this part right here use a different pen because cine y = x cosine y^ 2 is that's exactly right therefore sin y = < TK of 1 - x^2 oh that's where we're getting it from do you guys see it now so instead of sin y so this said cosine y hey cosine y was X therefore cosine y^ s cosine s y is x^2 now I have the substitution I'm going to put this right here therefore this proves that our derivative is equal to1 over < TK 1 - x^2 exactly what we have instead of U we have X but that's the whole idea sure feel okay with that would you follow that one it's not too bad right but that's why these look so weird is because since they're inverses when we change them back to original functions we do our whole derivatives well we got to change them back using that that inverse again so we're getting X's out of these because we' defin as cosine y = 2x now let's look at the the next one we'll do um let's do secant see inverse so proof for secant inverse if we have secant inverse X = Y this happens if and only if secant Y equals X well that's kind of nice we already have that we know that probably probably we're going to be substituting this back in at the very end because derivatives of secant give you back secant are you with me on this one so we know that this is true because of the definition of our inverses let's work with this guide again it's implicitly defined so we'll take a derivative with respect to X on both sides okay right hand side derivative everybody left hand side that wasn't everybody come on now left hand side derivative everybody well that was too fast I didn't even hear that wow see y tangent y very good see y tangent y yall with that yes sir okay fantastic d d i wasn't okay with that one what what are we missing here it's implicit you have to have that dydx is chain rule hey Y is a function of X so if Y is a function of X you've got to show that by the chain Rule now if we solve for dydx like the last time over here let's just divide by this therefore dydx = 1 see y tangent y are you still okay so far so use this idea okay inverses mean this for original functions we we should do the inverse uh this is defined this it can only if this no problem take a derivative implicitly that means with a chain rule you're going to have to do ydx otherwise we don't even have a a sign for our derivative that wouldn't make sense at all solve for our dydx we end up getting this now this is a problem because I've got y's and I want X's well one of these is really easy look at secant Y how much is secant y that's going to give us the X now the tangent y we got to do just a little bit more work for okay what we're going to do I'm going to draw a triangle and we're going to look at how this relates in a triangle so from here by the way I said this earlier you could have done the exact same thing with cosine yal X here's what you do uh what is my angle here x or y y is the angle what's the angle here y so Y is my Angle now if you were to think about cosine cosine would be what's cosine that's right adjacent over hypotenuse so if you don't don't write this down because I'm going to change it in a minute but just watch for a second if you were to do the cosine y = X1 cosine y would equal adjacent over hypotenuse you see it hey look at this this side is 1 - x^2 now if you took s of that angle s of that angle it's opposite over hypotenuse right there the same thing do you do you see what I'm talking about okay that's what we're going to use only now we're going to do it here did you follow that at all if not go back and watch the video next time it'll hopefully you you bet now because we're changing from cosine to secant we're have just a slightly different relationship uh secant is whatever what it's the reciprocal of cosine so it's not hypoten it's not adjacent over hypotenuse it's hypotenuse over adjacent so this would equal hypotenuse over adjacent does that make sense to you yes yes now by Pythagorean theem we can do this one really easy this will be theun of hypotenuse s minus s^ 2 x^2 - 1 are you okay with that one you can do Pythagorean theorem on your own if you want to call that side a or something uh you'd have x 1^2 + A2 = x^2 solve for a so x^2 - 1 take a square root you get this thing now what are we looking for if we try to do secant y well we already have it it's X over one that's how we got this triangle in the first place but this will allow you to find any other trigonometric relationship that's based on the angle y so if we need tangent y tan Y is what's tan again opp Opposite over adjacent but the one doesn't really matter so here we go dydx equals hey look at that that's positive 1 uh how much was secant y again now here's what we're going to do because X here is the hypotenuse a hypotenuse can't be negative it can't be even if you were to do this on your coordinate system that length is always positive to show that we put an absolute value so see see y gives us X we do absolute value X as a hypotenuse tangent well we found that tangent is the < TK of x^2 - 1 and we just proved I hope we proved it looks uh that looks right to me instead of 's we have X's but that's the prove for it uh you the only reason why you get the use in the dudx is by the chain wheel which works all the time for functions inside of functions show pant you okay with these ones it's interesting right it's a little weird but that's why we're getting these weird things it's just because of triangles it's just because of this stuff same stuff now would you like to see how to do this in practice yes probably so tell you what I'm going to move back over here because I want to keep these on the board so I'm going to these are going to be here for for basically our whole day till we get to integrals do you have any questions on the proofs okay okay okay let's see let's start with this then let's try to do the derivative of f ofx equal cosine inverse 5x now there's no need to go through all this proof over and over again these have all been proved so all we need to do is figure out which one of the six formulas we use use one of those six formulas appropriately plug in the right stuff in the right place and make sure you don't freaking forget the chain rule oh my goodness I'm strangly if well I'm sorry I'll s you your papers I'll punch your paper right in the face okay make sure make sure that you follow the chain Wheels a lot of people here go where am I getting the five from where where's that coming from why is the answer wrong in the back of the book you're wrong book no the book's right it's just you're forgetting the chain rule a lot okay it happens all the time so when we do this which one does this fit first one second 1 third 1 fourth one obviously it's cosine inverse so the way we do derivatives of cosine inverse if you want to do frime of X remember that notation it's a long time ago what this says is that well what's our u in this case yeah that's just the inside it's just a chain rule so covered up go okay this means I'm going to have -1 over there's going to be a square root there 1 minus I'm sorry what was the U again put the 5x here what do you need to do that 5x okay don't just Square the X don't put 5x s it's 5x quantity squared it's got to all be squared so this would look like this we plug it in without doing math in our head and then we do one more step after this okay so we're plugging this in we're going to have to do chain whe anyway to show that so you may as well not do this in your head sometimes you get to but for right now I want you practicing this and then we do derivative of whatever you oops U I wrote youu Whatever you just plugged in these should look the same all the time every time does that make sense okay so the derivative with respect to X of the function f is -1 over well calculus is basically done here 1 - 25 x^2 time what 5 yeah notice if you forget the chain rule you're forgetting a five so to clean this up just a little bit more we would put --5 over < TK 1 - 25x 2 that's our derivative is it straightforward enough for you guys to understand it yes since we proved these formulas I know they look weird but you can use them it's just a formula uh that's how we're doing derivatives of these inverse treat functions now of course we're going to make things a little bit more complicated more and more okay this was an easy one uh we're going to start building this stuff up little by little so let's practice some more here do you have any questions before we go on no okay all right all right let's find the derivative with respect to T of sin inverse of the Square t of 2T + 1 and you a man there lots of stuff in there well firstly identify what you're dealing with here we're dealing with an inverse trig function which means it's going to be on that list so on this list we're going to look at which one it is of course this is the very first one we had this is sign inverse so the way we go through these this the last I'm going to do for you just telling you how to do it after this I'm going to ask you some questions about it the way we go through this we first write out the formula identifying what our U is the U is always just the argument or the inside of your inverse trig function just like it is in the other ch rule so what is our U here Does it include the square root yes it does it's the whole inside of that inverse function are you guys okay with that one yeah so this is going to be let's see sign is sign positive or negative we get one we got a square root we've got a one we got a minus what do I put next 2 t + 1 and then what do I do well that's interesting isn't it so don't forget that this thing is squared it really should look like this this is why we don't do things in our head right now right now we're writing this out exactly like our formula says one one square root with the one square the one minus minus and then U okay I get U with the square and then I'm done right what do I need R it so times the derivative with respect to T make sure your variables match here of the < TK of 2 t + 1 you know what I don't like theun of 2T + 1 so I'm going to do 2T + 1 to the oh I love this stuff what do you need for that one there's man you guys you got to understand in calculus 2 we have chain RS and chain RS and all the time we're getting this stuff okay it shouldn't be hard because you did this you did train a lot in your your last class in calculus one but we're going to practice a ton of that so let's keep on going I know we got one I know we got a square root of one what happens here that okay please be careful on your algebra square root with square yes that's gone but don't do this you do that you get the problem wrong why that yes that's what we're talking about okay that that minus that's going to distribute now times let's do the derivative of 2T + 1 to the 1/2 what do we do with that bring the down sure it's our it's our chain rule it's a general power rule SO2 we got it do we do the derivative right now of this + 1 to the I wrote that poorly let me write rewrite that 1 12 like to be nice and neat here and then and then we're done all right times what derivative 2 T finally oh my goodness do we need a chain rule for this one no this is easy okay we finally got down to an easy one okay so we've got a 1 we got a square root we've got a 1 - 2 t - 1 - one we've got a you know let's start cleaning this up just a little bit let's put the one over two square root very good that moves down the denominator 2T + 1 * derivative of this whole thing is two that's two tell me some good things that happen the twos red twos are gone they simplify tell me something else that happens one's the radical look inside your square root what happens here these ones are gone that's right 1 - one is zero so we've got isn't that just T say what now isn't the two not just T it's actually -2t twos are gone we could actually make this all in one fraction if we wanted do 2T + one that's it that's our derivative can you handle it yes show hands if you can you okay with that one good deal okay now we're going to build up a little bit get to some things that are a little bit more interesting which means yes a little harder more advanced more advanced concepts question uh can you have a negative in the Square yeah but you got to keep in mind what your T can be defined as right here okay so your T would have to be negative but not so big as to make this negative so it's a really small small defined T okay good question any other questions besides that one this is probably just an algebra question you wouldn't be able to multiply those two together you actually can yeah uh you could if you because you have a square root times a square root you could do that distribute it I would leave it it's fine just like this okay moving on how about we try to conquer this one as you can see there's lots going on in this problem so let's go through it step by step to really make sure that we get it okay tell me the first thing that you're looking at here look at the Y say what now the Y the Y what do you mean the y y I think go Ln now well you know if we the Y are saying we have a function so I don't care about this one because if I do the derivative of y it's going to be dydx so the Y is okay we're okay on that side I mean on this side where all the nastiness is e the E okay so what are we going to do first we take the derivative of this or the derivative of this yeah because that's a chain rule that's going to be it's going to be like two chain rules like we had last time do you see the two chain rules I'm talking about we got chain rule because it's not just X then we've got chain rule cuz it's not just X we get two of them so Dy DX equals let's look at secant inverse so find secant inverse on your formula sheet or on the board as I've left it see inverse says we do what positive 1 or negative one so we're going to have positive one it says we do absolute value absolutely absolute value what goes inside of the absolute value yes right whatever's here argument of your inverse trig function goes there no matter what it is it doesn't matter you don't change it at all ever for this part e to the -2X and you just close it off well that's fairly easy you're just foll the formula then what do we do square root I got the square root oh man I'm going run a room square root what goes inside that's right okay so argument squ all squ make sure you get parentheses all squ and then [Music] what derivative oh yes a chain Ru derivative of what are you starting to see I know that many of you are are you starting to see how important the chain wheel is all the time starting to see how how you can't forget about it you get little pieces your your problem's blown I mean you screwed that problem up paper starts crying please No you're ruining me you've done that's just that's when I go crazy after I start grading like four test 14,000 tests oh my gosh I start making stuff up anyway so let's uh let's see if we can simplify this a little bit so we have dydx equal 1 does that change can you bring it up oh wait no never mind I how about this one can we simplify that a little bit yeah exponent raised to an exponent hello exponent raised to an exponent U so -2X * 2 gives you cool let's do this derivative now let's all do the I want you to do it on your own see if you get the right thing derivative of e2x we haven't practiced a whole bunch of those but we should be getting pretty good at them did you get the e to the -2X back yes yeah chain rule says this so dydx says all right well let's oh look at some nastiness here we got absolute value e to -2X no problem we got a s < TK e4x -1 got it we've got a e2x and then via the chain rule we got what's this one I'm going to put that in parentheses showing we're not subtracting it's a negative show H feel okay with that so far we're going to clean it up a little bit and talk about some pieces of this first first piece first piece talk about the absolute value here talk about the absolute value e to the -2X is that ever negative no so we drop the absolute value because e any base to a power no matter whether it's pos positive or negative is always positive so this is always going to be positive are you clear on that one so absolute values are gone Also let's bring this forward I've got -2 e to -2X I now have here without absolute value e -2X I've got a square otk of e4x minus one anything else we can do can you can you yeah is that being multiplied is that being multiplied did we get R the absolute value yeah you had to in order to do this by the way you had to get rid of that they're exactly the same simplify like you know what you're doing let's simplify those things so our derivative becomes actually quite nice we get -2 compar relatively ni e -4x - 1 we're done that's the whole idea so some simplification here but really the idea is use a formula don't forget the chain rule because you're going to have chain rules within chain rules within chain rules feel okay or no yes yes explain one more time why you drop the absolute value never be this is never negative think about it e e either goes ASM totic to the X as X to infinity or to the x is X approaches positive Infinity either way it's not dropping below the x-axis it's never negative so drop the absolute value you don't need it let's do one more and we're going to talk about the integrals this is about as advanced as I'm going to make it for you right here so if you can do this problem good to go I know I know that look it's nasty oh let's talk about what's going on here firstly write it down of course but then let's talk about what's going on first thing what do you see smacking you in the face question what do you see smacking you in the face right now when you see a problem two chain a function of function which means that you're going to do outside chain rule yeah First Chain rule this is a chain rule this is now the argument of cotangent you see it inside of this you have another chain rule so let's see how this thing works out this is not one time where you're going to want to do everything in your head okay uh do steps here follow the DDX in this case and see what it gives you so dydx if we're taking a derivative it says with chain rule take the derivative of the outside function leave the inside alone what's the derivative of coent remember coent is not this this isent inverse I'm not looking at this I'm looking the coent you should have in your head already good so this is cose squ of whatever this is and then am I done okay now what am I going to do chain rule with regards to just the x s or this whole thing yeah that's right so chain rule no problem derivative leave inside alone multiply by derivative of the inside that should be no brander we're okay with that okay so this equals negative cose s cosine inverse of x^2 oh goodness gracious times okay now we're going to do the derivative of cosine inverse X2 do it right now you should be good enough to do it it is a chain rule so that's the only advice I'll give you but go ahead I'm going to run the board see that you guys got the same thing on your own okay what I really want to know is did you get a -2X as well did you get a -2X somewhere did you get a2x if you did you did the chain rule appropriately if you didn't well you kind of messed something up so let's let's verify this is a cosine inverse x^2 going take a derivative of that that's this part -1/ 1 - u^ 2 did you all get that one X and Thena of the inside is 2x when we do this we get -2X 1 -4 we okay with that one y yes now this looks fine this looks fine this right here I want to look at this one a little bit we're going to talk about that for a second so let's see if we can manipulate cosine inverse of X squar using that whole triangle thing that we did before so little sidebar cosine inverse of X2 = let's call it Theta okay because what we should know about inverses is that what an inverse function equals is an angle does that make sense to you it's an inverse so this happens if and only if a triangles there if and only if cine Theta = X2 can you follow that logic yes just switch them now let's draw a triangle make that a Theta think about cosine Theta cosine is what over what please adjacent over hyp okay X2 for our adjacent one for our hypotenuse does that make sense to you yeah okay now let's fill out this let's fill out this so why don't you solve that if you can square root I'll give you the square root this squar minus this 1 - x 4 are we okay with that one now this is interesting check out what we just did so I'll I'll do a 10c recap for you just so you you see what's going on I'll real okay do the derivative down to here we probably should be right looking at this little piece cosine inverse x^2 we say okay call that an angle of a triangle no problem it has to be because it's inverse trig function this happens if and only if this is also true this is a one by the way look a t but that's a one well that means that our adjacent x^2 our hypotenuse is one we can solve for a missing side by Pythagorean theorem now think about what's going on here we just called this thinga does that make sense this angular relationship for Theta or this side relationship fora for anglea if this Isa I want to find cose OFA then Square it and make it negative so what I'm looking for now is cose are you aware that this Isa does that make sense to you that's what we call that's how we got our triangle so if this thing Isa let's just find cose cose Theta cosecant comes from s so if cosecant comes from s the reciprocal of sign hypotenuse over hypotenuse over opposite I want show Answer be okay with that one it's a little weird right we're using a triangle to our advantage though we're saying yeah sign would be this over this therefore Co cosecant is this over this no problems you see how to use that it's kind of cool right use the inside to make up triangle then finding cose of that angle of your triangle that you just found it's awesome now we don't really want cosecant Theta itself we want cosecant squar and then we're going to make it negative so if I want cose squet all I have to do is square the numerator and denominator that means I get 1 over 1 - x 4th because if I Square this I Square this one and then Square Root's gone are we okay with that one yeah last step if I want this to be negative put a negative so negative cose gives you1 over 1 - x 4 now let's put all of this crap together this piece from our triangle is 1/ 1 - x 4 this piece that's easy this is -2X over < TK 1 - x 4 you ready for some Fancy Pants math a little bit Fancy Pants math you ready do okay when you have x to the 1st * x to the 12 we get x to the 3 agreed yeah as we add that's what we're going to do here this is to the first Power this is to the 1/2 power therefore when we multiply we're going to get a POS 2X and we're going to get 1 - x 4 to the 3 half power and that's it that's as simple as we can make that one what I'm really concerned about is that you can get down to here as far as your derivatives did you understand that yeah and I'm also concerned about cuz we're going to use a lot we're going to use this a lot this idea of making a triangle and using a triangle did you follow that it's interesting though isn't it it's a little bit bizarre because maybe some of you hadn't done that before but you see that it's possible hello yes no yeah you sure all right let's talk about one more we move on to integrals and I'll wipe off the whole board here so on the test this is what I want want it all the way down yep so we have to you got to know you got to do that so maybe behoove you to uh practice this a couple times really come by and see me if you need to watch the video again practice that a few times get in the triangle on your own okay don't just follow my notes do it on your own okay one more uh we'll talk about this if I ask you to do the derivative of tan inverse X Plus xent inverse X could you do it could can you take the derivative do you have to do this all at once or can you do this piece this piece that piece and that good we can separate by addition that's fantastic can you do the derivative of tan inverse X yeah that's really easy actually no chain rule at all what would you have to do for this derivative R good this one would be easy this one you have it right on your formula so be aware of things like that and we should be good to go do you guys feel okay with our derivatives yeah okay now I want you to notice something here look back at our derivatives do you see that there's really only three different types of derivatives and the other three are just negatives of them yeah identical just negative identical just negative identical just negative what that means is that we really only need three new pieces of our integration table what we're going to do is we're going to take this one we're going to take this one and we're going to take this one so we're going to be able to find the integrals of here here and here because if they were negative you just pull them in front of your integral anyway wouldn't you I would so here's our new integration table we only need three because the other three are are negatives of the rest let's say we have an integral and we can make it 1 over < TK 1 - u^2 D what are we going to get out of that let's find it which one's it like that's that's well not quite inverse sin inverse u+ see that's exactly right what are you going to have to do a lot in these next problems do you think you're to substitute like Mad Dogs all the time substitute substitute substitute hold time okay how about we do 1 over 1 + U ^2 U what are we going to get out of that integral if we can make it look like 1 1 + U ^2 it's going to become tan inverse if der of tan inverse gives you this the integral of this gives you tan inverse now because we we get a small difference between between this and this I want to show you that when we do one over this this doesn't look exactly like this one but it doesn't matter because of the domain of the seant inverse what happens here is we don't actually have to have the absolute value but we do get them in our secant like that just be it's a domain issue are we okay with those three so if we get something look like this gu sin inverse something looked like this tan inverse something look like this because it's just like that one we're going to see inverse if you had negatives check this out yes you could call that what be cosecant inverse but for us we just pull the negative outside call it negative see inverse that's the whole idea should we try some sure I'd like to I'd like to do it right now and not next time just so it's really fresh in our heads this whole idea a t will start out really easy and gradually build up to where it's harder you mean more fun more fun yeah now of course what I've told you is that if it doesn't look exactly like something in your integration table which you've just added to right now with three new integrals it doesn't look like that what do you need for it so we're going to have to do a substitution here's the idea your goal is to try to try to make this thing a one minus something squared so for us one idea would be let's leave the square root we'll leave the one cuz that's great but you need to write this as something squared and then make a substitution so instead of 16 x^2 I don't like that I want want something squared cuz that little something there that's what we're going to call the U that's why it's defined as a u over here what's going to be in [Music] there yeah that's exactly right and now a substitution is just so nice don't forget the substitution here but if we do U = 4X then du = 4 DX or du over 4al DX notice what I'm not doing you looking notice what I'm not doing I'm not doing a whole substitution right here if I tried to do that I would get an X do you see any other X's up here be stuck so we have to have these inverse trick functions to be able to do some of these integrals it's really interesting we can't do this any other way than what we what we have with our inverses here this is the integral so we have this we got okay well no no let's make it work so let's call that says 16x2 4X squ do a little substitution are you guys okay with the substitution yeah now we still have the one we still have the square root we still have this one we still have the minus but how much is this now and that's exactly what we want to see and instead of DX we have what and then good D over4 and then sure with the with the over four let's make that 1/4 so 1/4 integral 1 overare < TK 1 - u^2 hey look at that that's what substitution does for us it makes things fit so if this fits which one does this fit is this the sign inverse the tangent inverse or the secant inverse so this says we're going to have 1/4 s inverse U plus C if you want to right now which equals 1/4 sin inverse why am I not stopping at sin inverse U why am I not doing that started with x's right we want to end with x's so instead of sin inverse U we're going to have s inverse of what that's right that my friends the whole idea let's start one more make as much progress as we can and then we'll call it good check out this one integral of 1 < tk25 - x^2 DX does this look like this no so we're going to have to do a substitution but I want to show you this one because this happens um some some books some formulas are actually allow for for this case and they'll show you a a different integral table for this I'm a simple guy I'm a simple man so what I like to do is I like to make it fit perfectly and how you can do this just just watch along how you can do this is force this to factor Force this to be a factor and do something like this instead of 25 - x^2 do 25 * 1 - x^2 over 25 do you see that we can force that to be a factor that way just divide out the 25 if you distribute you'll notice this 25 - x^2 the 25s would go away does that make sense hello yes no now what this allows you to do is break up this square root so we're going to do two steps here we're going to do one over well here's the square root of 25 how much is the square root of 25 that's great times the square root don't forget about that second square root you're breaking this out by a product 1 minus and I'm also going to make this into a square so instead of x^2 over 25 I'm going to think about this as something squared what is it x x over 5 would work great so little recap we've got no I don't like 25 I want to make that one I want to make it one so that it fits my integration table so I'm making this into a one by forcing it to factor forcing the 25 to factor out are you following me on that one yeah yes no do you see that it is the same thing yeah separate your square roots get rid of that number get rid of that square root of 25 whatever whatever constant you have factored out smooth that out even if it's not even a perfect square you can still do this it's just awkward it's a little looks a little worse oh it's a constant constant yeah now square root of it well no I don't like x^2 - 25 I need something squared so I can make a substitution you follow yeah okay so what we do we say all right how much is our our U going to be uh X if we have X over 5 then duu = 15 DX and 5 du = DX almost done stick with me okay I got to wrap things up so here's one how much is square of 25 everybody so we got a five here I've got a square root inside my square root please tell me inside my square root what do I got 1- and instead of DX I have oh no it's not look what happens a lot of the times this happens here do you see what happens FES are gone that's awesome fives are gone we have the integral of 1 over 1 < TK of 1 - U how much is the integral of 1un of 1 - ^2 sign that's on your table so this would be sin inverse U + C or wrapping it up sin inverse of let's do our substitution again x 5 plus c did that one make sense to you oh yeah so even if it doesn't quite work with a one factor the constant out make it Factor if it factors you can get rid of that constant square root of whatever number you have pull it out front often times what happens is when you substitute back in this number will match up with that number a lot of the times you can cross it out and then just do a very basic intergal so last time we learned all about the integrals that give us some of these inverse trig functions we got a couple more examples and then we'll be done with our section so let's look at the integral of e x over e 2x + 1 now on first glance you might be thinking well let's just use a basic substitution and be done with this thing let's take a look at that is a substitution going to work for this what do you think if I substitute for this if I make that a u is this going to get rid of that if I make this a u is this going to get rid of that no yeah yeah I'd have something else though two so I I get this back again do you guys see that yeah so no not quite that would be kind of an issue here so what we're going to do instead is we're going to try to rewrite this to make it fit one of these things do you remember doing that when it doesn't when it doesn't fit your integration table exactly like that we're going to rewrite it we're going to try to make it fit something here's what I'm seeing uh the reason why this is for me this is noticeable is okay I see a plus one I like plus one I see something being squared do you see what I'm talking about something being squared so instead of doing just a regular substitution we're going to make it so that when we substitute yeah it's going to be a substitution but when we substitute it's going to fit one of these things so let's break this down a little bit so yeah this is this isn't e to the 2x this is e to the X yeah we can do that because when we take exponent to exponent we m multiply therefore 2x as an exponent becomes X and then squ you guys okay with that one so far yeah now check it out when we go through and do do our substitution let's substitute for the appropriate thing what is our substitution here wait the whole thing or just this thing just this thing why we're doing just this thing is because we want to make it fit that thing well that's going to be kind of nice if I take the derivative of that what's the derivative of e to X please and D oh look at that this is this we can just do a straight substitution so our integral becomes tell me what it is what's on the numerator of my integral yeah or or what could you put put du if you really want to do that what's on the denominator and then yeah don't forget you have to match up your ver this is not relev this why your your Calculus one teacher made you put du or DX or D whatever you have to match that up show hands be okay with that so far does it fit now a piece of cake now which which one is this tan inverse U is what that is it looks exactly the same it's only well a distance commutative no big deal but looks exactly the same plus C if you want to right now or later tan inverse what one thing we have to do though we have to substitute this back in E to X plus C we feel okay with that your fans if you feel not not so bad awesome so bad not so bad not so bad not so bad any questions on that one no these become pretty easy when you know what you're looking for for instance I know I'm dealing in a section that has inverse streat functions hello I'm going to try to make it like one of these when you're not when you're just doing problems on your own like I give you on a test might be a little more difficult so you really do need to practice looking at these problems identifying man what am I going to do with this thing try to make it fit have your integration table next to you be looking at it going well how does this best fit if a substitution doesn't work right away try something else don't force it if it's not working okay question so you're able to do that because the exponential right CU that's like just saying two * x e 2x is e x^2 that's that's that's how I'm looking at that okay last one let's look at it does it look anything like anything in our integration table kind of kind of well it's got a square root right so it's not this it's either this one or this one let's see if a substitution would work how about this one look at this what a substitution work yeah if the X was here absolutely yes do you see why yeah the derivative is 18x do you see that X's would go away if the X is not here if the x is here oh wait a minute that's sorry my bad that's 1 /x no the derivative of this is not 1 /x does that make sense to you the derivative of sub substitution has to be there if it's not then it will not work so let's try to manipulate this thing into looking like one of these so uh what's your first idea what do you want to do to look something very good because we like the square root don't we we're not going to change that we don't like the 9x2 we like the minus one don't we do you guys see that we like that one what we don't like is the fact that this is not something being squared so change it to something being s and someone said it already what is it that already looks a little bit better but does it fit exactly our Paradigm for for this over here not yet yeah good substitution so let's do that if we do a substitution uh please watch carefully because something kind of interesting happens here when we do a substitution for 3x yeah du = 3 DX or du over 3 = DX you guys okay with that one on the numerator we got one on the denominator be careful what do we have oh before that did we take care of that x no that's a problem so X do we still have a square root yeah what's inside and then instead of DX we have perfect show hands feel okay with that so far so same idea as last time we're saying no no no I don't like that I'm trying to make it fit try to make it fit one of these things since I see a variable outside it's not this one it's not this one because that doesn't have square root it's mostly like this one we're going to try to F make it fit this one now here's the issue this looks really good I did my substitution I've already done done away with the DX I've already done away with the 3x I got a u^2 - 1 that looks perfect I've got a du this is the problem do you see your variables have to match here they all got to be the same so one thing that you can do use your substitution again I'll say it again use your substitution again so for instance If U equals 3 please listen and watch carefully If U = 3x that also means that X = U over 3 does that make sense to you ah can you now get rid of the X Okay so 1 x no no no no no you can't have this so use your substitution again one over I'm going to draw it in purple that way you can see what I'm doing here this x check it out this x is u over3 u over 3 well the u^2 minus one was great D over3 no big deal so the idea again first are you okay with doing the first step are you okay that we're picking 3x as our substitution kind of have to right if we do that then we can also make X just solve for x x now equals U over3 that allows you later to change any variables extraneous variables that aren't used into use so X now becomes U over3 no big deal now it fits tell me what happens with our threes they're gone they're gone this is over three this is like over over three ha so we you can reciprocate that up this actually moves through the numerator that's denominator they're gone well this is pretty easy then this integral now becomes 1 / U < TK U ^2 - 1 du I need a quick head not if you're okay with with that so far does it make sense it's interesting right it's a little bit tricky because you got to do something that X you can't leave it so use your substitution again no big deal now does that fit our our integral model perfectly how much is it absolute value U plus C very good and of course we never leave that we're going to have secant inverse absolute value what's in there that ladies and gentlemen is the correct integration should F be okay with what we've talked about that basically wraps it up uh that wraps up this section so what I'm expecting from you is that you're able to find these type of integrals nothing super super super crazy right now yeah they're going be a little bit harder on your homework some of them some a lot of them will be just like this I really just want to make sure that you're you're getting used to the idea of substituting to make it fit your integration table we just now have three new integrals that we can work with any questions or comments or do you feel good about it good just want
