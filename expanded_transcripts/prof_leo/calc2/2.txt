Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 6.3:  Derivatives and Integrals of Exponential Functions
so let's do it 6.3 we're going to talk about some exponential functions in order to do that I've got to define a number for you uh we're going to Define what the base of a natural logarithm is I think you've probably seen this before E you ever heard of the the number e before number e is awesome number uh this guy guy way back in uh the old days name was Leonard Oiler I know awesome name uh discovered this number it's an irrational number goes forever very much like Pi 2.7 blah blah blah blah blah BL forever never and never it's not rational occurs so much that this guy said you know what this is crazy this number is found in nature all the time we use it for engineering all the time uh this number e we're going to call it the Oiler number cuz in in German Oiler is not spelled o i l e r it's spelled e u l e r so the E comes from Oiler but spelled different than than we usually spell it so anyway it's called the oiler number or the natural number and how we Define it e is defined as this it's a number that when I say Ln of this number it gives me one so give you another definition too it's kind of a more mathematical one says hey you know what if I had uh do you remember this yeah that was true because we developed that basically in the kind of the first day of class we we did that we said l x is equal to the integral from 1 to X of 1 T DT well what that implies is that if x now becomes e Ln X well Ln e 1 to X well one to e this has to equal one sorry forgot my equals if l equals 1 that's our definition here folks that means that this integral also has to equal one the do you guys remember that the integral is the area under a curve between two points that's what a different integral is so what this says is the area under this curve is one another way we can find it by the way if you're curious as to whether this number actually exists by the intermediate value theorem it has to exist um by the IBT because so a little bit of a side note here because natural log function is continuous everywhere if I could spell it right and the range and the range is negative Infinity to to POS Infinity what the intive value theem says is this if a function is continuous along its range then for any number along the range you can find an input that that verifies that output so basically it says because natural log looks like this the range goes from negative Infinity to positive Infinity do you remember this this graph here is a that one because it goes from negative Infinity to positive Infinity that means that any output that I choose has to have some sort of an input that's what intermediate value theorem says well because natural log is continuous everywhere and because the range is negative Infinity to Infinity that means that there has to be some input that when I plug it in it gives me one there has to be does that make sense to you there's got to be it goes from negative Infinity to Infinity every single point is continuous it's continuous there's no holes or gaps that means that I've got to be able to plug something in to get a one we call that number e that's how it's defined does that make sense to you okay so the the number e has to exist it's got to be part of the function um last definition that we got for this so we Define it if Ln of y = x we have that if and only if e to xal Y that's how we go back and forth doing exponentials and logi notation if you don't remember that what's the base of Ln says base to the power gives you the argument of log that's what we have right here now what's kind of cool about this is we got a couple properties that are going to help us solve equations that have e or Ln in them so I'm going to go over those properties with you right here we're going do a few examples so first property first one is kind of so nice the first one is this if you have Ln of e to X so Ln of e to X do you know what the answer is going to be okay you could you can move the the X in front of the Ln do you remember doing that yeah okay but this is also cool how much is Ln of e that was our definition so what this is equal to is X the reason why is you want the proof here's the proof right next to it if you bring this down we have X Ln e how much l of one equals x there's the proof for that number two the other one if we have e to the Ln X do you know how much that's equal to it's equal to X it's also equal to X for a very similar reason so this also equals x I can actually prove it to you if you really want me two here's the proof uh if you have e to the Ln xal X check it out if you didn't know that these were equal we can prove that equal by getting down to the same thing on both sides so take Ln of both sides if you do we would get Ln e to Ln xal Ln X are you guys with me on that taking Ln on both sides what can I do with this so Ln x * Ln e = Ln don't even bother uh what do we have here this is equal to one it proves that those two sides are equal therefore these two sides are equal therefore this is a true statement are you guys okay with those ones practically it's this whenever you have e next to Ln here or here you can say they cancel each other they eliminate each other in other words we're going to get whatever the argument is whatever X is that's going to be our answer show hands field with those ones what this allows you to do is solve some exponential or logarithmic equations really nicely we're going to practice just a few of them right now and talk about how this stuff works for us so we take a little break from calculus I suppose we're start just do some algebra to make sure you guys are good with this stuff okay so it's an equation we should be able to solve it in this class so we got e 4 - 5x = 9 we go oh my gosh how in the world are we going to solve that thing what do you think yeah we can do anything we want to on both sides as long as we do it to both sides of our equation we can take both sides to and make it a power of E we can take both sides and put Ln in front of it as long as you do to both sides what I can't have you do is do Ln here and forget to do Ln here that's kind of a rookie mistake that a lot of people make but don't forget that you can actually take Ln of both sides so if we do that we do Ln of e 4 - 5x we do Ln of 9 someone out there explain to me why in the world we just did that we do have to do to both sides but why did we bother with Ln good very good um you can do this one of two ways you can bring the exponent down if you want to you can just understand that because of this property this is proved right if something's proved you get to use it so this says that our answer is going to be this argument this exponent right here so yeah you can bring it down make sure it's in parenthesis okay don't forget those freaking parenthesis you can bring it down you oh that's one multiply by one you get 4 - 5x or in other words look here look here this is 4 - 5x it's magic no that's not magic we proved it right it's it has to work proved it equals ln9 don't forget about the L on the right hand side quick head down if you're okay with that one we're moving kind of quick here because this is algebra I just want to refresh your memories now what do we Dove yeah just solve it so we're going to take cool subtract four but yeah you're close so I'm going to put that up front because we're going change signs here so -4 + Ln 9 last step what's the last step everybody when you're yeah if we divide by5 we get X = pos4 fsus Ln of 9 over 5 are you guys okay with the algebra on that one yeah so it allows us to solve some things really really nicely that we otherwise wouldn't have been able to do tell you what we'll try I don't know three four more together and then we'll call this Good okay let's go kind of almost row by Row first two rows what would you do first on this step would you do Ln on both sides right now good idea bad idea what would you do first yeah in order for us to do Ln on both sides we have to have the E isolated okay so this two not so bleno we're going to get rid of that thing we're going to have e 5x - 1 = 23 well that's a little bit better because now we can actually take an Ln on both sides that's our next step so whenever we get caught and we have wow we have some number raised to a power when we can't find common bases take an Ln on both sides match up Ln with e we'll be able to simplify that you just got to make sure that you don't neglect it on the right hand side okay uh middle people what are we going to have on the left hand side perfect these are gone if you if you're the type of person who has to cross stuff out fine cross it out I don't care you just need to know that our answer on the left or our answer the expression left hand side is 5x - one okay other middle people you guys what's the next step for sure so if we add one one quick thing this is a little bit ambiguous as to what you're doing use parenthesis appropriately here right now don't add one to 2/3 please don't do that use parentheses that way I know you understand that it's l of 2/3 and then after that you're going to be adding one is that clear and then lastly we'll divide by five you can separate into fractions if you really want to or you leave it's just like that still so far so good yeah it's all right okay how about this one one [Applause] more is this one of the ones where we want to take Ln on both sides no no that's silly so we got what undoes Ln sure so what do we do make each side an exponent of e so take e on both sides that's fine I don't care so e Ln 7x -1 equals do we have to do on the right hand side it's an equation okay left hand side what happens e to the Ln of whatever I have is that's this one whenever I have this our expression changes just to whatever the exponent is so in our case these are gone we get 7 x -1 = e to the 9th after that man piece of K just solve for x how are we going to solve for x perfect so if I add 1 we get x = e to 9th + 1 if I divide by 7 put the whole thing as 7 or you can write this as e 9th + 1 * 1 7 either way is appropriate and I really don't care show hands you feel okay with how to solve these basic ones all right we'll practice a couple more next time and we'll talk start talking about how to do derivatives of e so we're going to continue talking about how to solve these equations that involve Ln or E tox now one thing you'll notice on this equation we got Ln everywhere one good idea that you have by the way I'm going to go through these quickly because this doesn't really involve calculus I just want to give you a little Refresh on how to do some of these ones uh things that you can and can't do so whenever you involve Ln on both sides of your equation one good idea would be to combine and make one Ln on each side if you can uh once you do that what's going to get rid of Ln for us good okay so can we make one Ln on each side yeah how would I do that okay so if I have Ln plus Ln I know that I can combine those via uh multiplication as soon as you have that you have one Lon on one side and anything else on the other side basically as long as you have all your variables on one side and something else on the other side take e put e on both sides and treat these as exponents of e once we do that you guys already told me that you can by the way when I do the E thing do I do it to one side or both sides both Sid yeah it is an equation you have to do it to both sides in this case that's actually really nice because I had Ln on both sides that means that when I do e on both sides everything's going to be gone except for my x's and my constants so on the left hand side tell me what happens when I have e next to Ln pretty much in any scenario what happens okay what am I going to have left on the left hand side perfect right hand side two fantastic can we keep going this becomes a pretty easy pretty straightforward at least algebra problem let's go ahead and solve for x we will do what anytime you see an X squar you're going to well you're going to try to factor it uh somehow if you can't Factor it what would you use sure so there's really three ways right there's there's factoring which is the quickest if you know how to factor really well then there's completing the square we we rarely do that really because we can go straight to quadratic formula so here we'd have x^2 - x we'd subtract the two can you factor that one as I've been rambling hopefully you've been factoring yeah minus two which means that if we have this we set each of these equal to zero by the zero product property and we get x = pos2 and x = -1 quick show has be okay with both our Solutions are you sure yeah you sure you're sure you better look back at your problem here real quick folks because we need we need to know something about the domain of the natural log function X has to be bigger than zero that's right X has to be positive so are both of these valid Solutions no no which one's wrong so we actually only have one real solution here whenever you find your answers for for Ln please please check them make sure you go back to your original not here not uh not here but here your original plug it in make sure that you don't have anything that falls outside the domain otherwise we have an issue there quick head on if you're okay with that one okay uh let's do one more switch up a little bit we'll try something like this you know you've had something similar to this in probably your pre-calculus class or maybe an advanced algebra or whatever whenever we have a scenario where we have a trinomial what's really nice is if we can fit this into some sort of a um a quadratic we want to try to fit this into a quadratic can you fit this into a quadratic form here's how you know you look at your middle term you look at your first term if you can take the variable part of your middle term and the same as sorry if this is the the same as your middle term squared then you can make a substitution and make it a quadratic for instance if I were to rewrite this I say well wait a minute let's look here and here can I write this as e to X squar is that the same thing yeah this is not the same as this or this is the same as this same same it's not okay do you remember your exponent rules it okay let's practice next next rules s or 12 let's all try this and get it right this time 7 or 12 oh dear lord how about this one seven or 12 seven oh thank God okay seven okay good is this the same yes yes because you multiply what's x * 2 x * 2 is 2x are you clear on this one are you sure okay I'm glad we went over this huh wow goodness minus5 let's keep this in parenthesis here real quick here's what you try to do if you don't know immediately how to solve this problem cuz I'm guessing you you look at that and go um uh I don't know well if it's got three terms in it maybe try to make it into a quadratic what I saw right off the bat is that this is this part squared do you see what I'm talking about this is this part squared if that's the case notice how we have exact the same thing here and here are you guys with me on that exactly the same thing whenever you have that one part's being squared one part's not being squ s you can use a substitution just create a dummy variable like y if you do a substitution like y = edx then instead of writing edx everywhere what could we write everywhere because I asked you just joking some people got this stand up next time you'll get it whatever it was funny you missed it I'm not going to edit that out watch it again and you'll laugh I promise so so instead of e x we got well we got y^2 - 5 y + 6 = do you see why that helps us why does that help us because it's easy say what now why does it help us quadratic you can actually Factor yeah you can Factor Quadra whatever you want so this allows us to actually do some things with it where this one didn't so once you get down to here Matt this should be a piece of cake can you guys Factor this x MH Ian yeah be careful with these ones a lot of people do is FES and ones or sixes and ones you we have to have the correct numbers here this is3 -2 so y - 3 y - 2 we okay with that one that means that y = 3 and Y = 2 y = 3 and Y = 2 and are we going to stop right there well let's look back are variable was in terms of X at the very beginning what's the variable we ended with that's not a good thing so can we get back to X's well this is like your trail of breadcrumbs this told you what you did right so if we made a substitution y for E DX now we're going to reverse that we're going to do a substitution edx for our y are you guys okay with that so far I know it's just algebra but I want to make sure you guys are good at this so instead of yal 3 what can I write please and instead of Y = 2 I could have e to x = 2 that's excellent now oh my goodness can you solve that if e to the x equals 2 Can You Solve IT how would you solve it yeah which which particular type of log the natural log that's right the natural log guess we want to match up our our bases so if we take a natural log on both sides like this Ln e x = Ln 2 do you guys remember we went over it yesterday um remember what happens anytime you have Ln next to an E we could move this forward Ln of e is is one so what's on the left hand side of our equation on the right hand side that's actually one of our Solutions so X is ln3 natural log 3 over here same thing happens we get xals that's it I want to Quick show hands if you feel okay with that algebra you sure are there any questions at all so our ideas are once again if you have multiple LNS try to try to combine them because that way when we do e on both sides it actually works out okay otherwise it's not going to work out also whenever we have some things that have potential be quadratics try substitution try to work with some of the algebra techniques that you've already learned that'll often times make it easier are we okay with uh with these two okay before we get on to the calculus involving uh exponential e to the X we got to talk about a few properties so make a few notes here these are going to be important we're going to use these a lot it's it's going to be help for us helpful for us to have a good picture of what the function adx actually looks like then these properties are going to make a lot more sense to you do you guys have a good picture of what edx looks like in your head do you know what it looks like no does it go it does it look like Ln is it a straight line okay let's start easy if you plug in zero how much is it going to give you you plug in zero e to the 0 is good so we're going to cross for sure at 01 notice how he's about the number 2.7 all right so if we plug in bigger numbers if we plug in like one I'm going to get up 2.7 if I plug in two that's going to be 2.7 squar plug in three 2.7 to the thir power and so on and so on is it going to climb or fall climb and climb fast it's an exponential exponentials climb fast over here negatives if I plug in negative 1 am I going to get a negative number no no if I plug in any negative am I going to get a negative number so this thing is going to be above the xaxis all the time can you verify that for me it will never cross the xaxis because it never actually equals zero so what this thing looks like it does cross at 01 it climbs over here it's asmic to the xais as we go to negative numbers have you seen that before yeah it's that function it climbs the whole time we okay with that one well if we got a picture of this you guys see y by the way if we put if we plug in negatives such as e to the -2 really that's just 1/ e^2 it's not negative it's just a really small number and it gets smaller the more negative number we put in there if we got the picture these ones make a lot of sense firstly let's talk about the domain and the range domain the domain is well the inputs or the outputs you guys should know that good and well what is that is it the inputs or the outputs domain always has to do with the inputs so what can you plug into edx is there any restriction on it whatsoever no then you're correct about the domain domain is negative Infinity to Infinity it says that you can plug in anything along the x-axis you're good to go you're always going to find an output for that make sense okay how about the the range is the range negative Infinity to Infinity what do we get out of this thing Z to do we actually get out zero no okay so how can I show that with my range uhhuh do you remember doing the interval notation when yeah we we don't get out any negatives firstly verify that for me can you see that we don't get out any negatives so that's not in a Range we don't get out zero but we get things that are very close to zero it's almost like that limit idea that you have we get really we approach it we never get to it so we use the parentheses to signify that how high do we go yeah can you guys see those the domain and the range on the picture does it makees sense to you all right oh yeah next up continuity where is it continuous for continuity we always use the domain idea of that we say the the X values or the input values for which this thing is continuous so what's the interval of continuity for our function is it continuous everywhere is what I'm asking you is it continuous everywhere so it's continuous on its entire domain what's also interesting let's talk about concavity does this function ever change concavity ever remember what concavity is concavity is the way the the the SHP the Curve the shape is curved that doesn't make sense the curve is shaped so it's either increasing in an increasing fashion or increasing in a decreasing fashion this happens to be concave up increasing in an increasing fashion so here we have concave up also for the entire domain which is interesting it's always holding water I think that you learned that in calculus one if it can hold water then it's concave up if it's an umbrella then it's concave down well this thing's always concave up the entire the entire curve also we talk about one more thing and we'll give you some examples here let's talk about the limit as X approaches positive infinity and the limit as X approaches negative Infinity so how much is the limit of e tox as X approaches positive Infinity do you remember what that means means as we go this way where's our function going is it going up down or level up forever and ever and ever so what's the limit of e x as X approaches positive Infinity what is it infity yeah it's going way up there it's going to Infinity how about the other way what if we go all the way to the left so as X approaches negative Infinity what is our function doing what's our function's value as X gets further and further further away negative how much what's it going to Z zero that's right I'm going to give you two more uh this really isn't in exponentials but it's going to help you because sometimes we deal with limit as far as Ln goes as well so I want to give this to you as well if you remember this I hope that you do the function e tox and the function Ln X are inverses do you remember that so Ln X looks like this graph I think I drew it for you earlier where looks like that you remember that that would be Ln X so e x and Ln X if I go to positive Infinity for the lnx function what's the limit as X approaches positive Infinity of l x it's still Infinity it's it's climbing slower but it's still climbing you guys okay with that one are you sure okay how about the limit should I make this limit go to negative Infinity for lnx no is that even relevant no can I plug in negatives at all to my Ln function I don't know are look at this the dotted line are there any negatives over here does the dotted graph exist over here then that would make no sense what number do I want to see this approach zero can I do this would that make sense no no it has to be from the positive side very good uh when we're talking about limits remember that for a limit to exist it must exist in both directions so if I have this is is actually inaccurate this says that this would be from both ways and that's not the case it doesn't even exist over here so we'd say from the right from the right hand side what's happening here are you guys okay with that notation this says find the limit of Ln x no problem as X approaches zero okay I know where that's at from not both sides it do even exist over here but from the right hand side so what's happening to my function Ln X as I'm going this way getting closer and closer and closer to zero What's the value of my function approaching it's not zero it's going down down down down down negative infity that's a horrible negative infity there we go would you like a couple examples on how to use this in some limits because you're going to have to do you want to see some firstly do these properties make sense now that you have a good picture of what the Ln and what the edx look like good let's do some examples and actually apply it real quick examples oops for okay let's take a look at that one so limit X approaches infity e x- 2 e 2x over my goodness that looks like a bunch of junk you know what it's really hard to think about what's going on when you have all those negative exponents floating around isn't it go wait a second this is this is e to the negative but that's negative infin so e to the that would really be Infinity well that that's Infinity already so if you think about this this would be Infinity well that's going to be zero but this is going to be Infinity over infinity can we do limits if you have Infinity over infinity does the let's see if you know uh true or false Infinity over infinity it's what no that's not true we can't do that so we got to work around this somehow and I believe in your 4A class what your teacher should have told you is that you're going to look at your denominator and you're going to divide by part of your denominator typically it's the largest exponent here because we're going to NE Infinity it's going to really suit us to get rid of this e to the -2X because what that's giving us this is giving us an Infinity here does that make sense to you that's the problem so what I want to do I want to show you a couple tricks on how you you get around these ideas one thing I'm going to do here I'm going to take this by the way you're you typically always in your this isn't really a rational function U but when you have these fractions you'll typically divide by something down here not up here you'll usually look here okay otherwise you can if you divide by the wrong thing you can get u a zero on the denominator which of course we can't have that so you typically divide by some term down here I'm going to divide everything by E to the- 2x let's see if we can do this together okay I'm still going to have a limit negative Infinity remember when we divide we're dividing every single one of these terms so let's let's do this uh how much is e to thex / e to -2X how much is e tox / e to -2X recall that when we divide common bases which have exponents this is what we're doing here folks are you guys okay with that idea what do you do with your exponents you add or subtract subract Sox minus -2X how much is that so that's e to X are you okay with the E to XX - -2X we're basically adding x + 2x minus how about this one let's do that one I'm going change this around here we have 2 e 2x over e2x remember that we're dividing each term by this so each term by this what's our answer going to be so we're still going up to two though right again what do you do when you have exponents over exponents you add or subtract 2 - -2 that's e to the how much are you okay with these I'm not getting a whole lot of participation do you see where these are coming from are you sure so 2 e to 4 okay that's cool now this one should be easy what happens when you take something and you divide it by itself how much is that I love that one this is one and lastly if we have 3 e to 2x what's going to give us okay well that makes it at least a little bit more manageable let's see what happens here um oh you know what we actually have some properties for that we have some limits we should know what that means let's think about this for a second what happens when I go e to the infinity what what is that what's the limit as X approaches negative Infinity of e tox it should be right right down there how much is that so this thing is zero how about e to oh 4X well think about this what's uh what's 4 * negative Infinity if you were allowed to plug that in what would that be still be negative Infinity okay so this is still e to the negative Infinity how much is that Z still zero are you guys okay with that one so this is still zero one how much is one one one that's nice I like that that's what we're trying to get that's why we divided so we can get this constant in there somewhere how much is oh look at this we have basically the same thing how much is e 4X again as X approaches negative Infinity it's a still 0 so practically we have 0 - 0 over 1 + 0 I messed up 0 - 0 1 + 0 that's 0 over 1 is it okay to have 0 over one would it be okay to have one over zero okay so that's why we divide by the largest power in the denominator not the numerator what's that give us zero this limit is zero if you know anything about uh limits what this basically says to you is that you for this function you are going to have a horizontal ASM toote to the left at at y equal 0 that's what that's doing so it looks practically like this show feel okay with that idea all right let's talk about one more there's not going to be a whole lot of algebraic work in this next one but I want you to think through what's going on okay so second example okay these things can really make you crazy all right they really can but stick with it follow what the properties are telling you and change little pieces uh to start with so I want to start with we're not going to do anything in this problem okay we're just going to think about it we're going to think what what each piece means let's start here don't even worry about the one over just tell me what is lnx what's the limit of Ln X as X approaches zero from the right we had that down here didn't we so we had zero from right and eight so this piece right here that little piece the Ln X is going to negative Infinity do you guys follow me what I'm talking about how much is one over remember this is negative Infinity how much is one over something that's going to negative Infinity Z going how much is um 1 over1 whatever this is really close to Z it's really close to zero yeah it's negative but it's really really close to zero does that make sense so if this is negative Infinity how much is this Z it's zero does that make sense to you I know it's negative but it's a really small negative number uh wow infinitely how would you say that really small absolute value wise it's a really small infinitely small yeah infinitesimally small so this little thing right here dead blow your mind's like mind grenade are you guys with me let's start over because I'm getting some blank looks like you're going what um so today's lesson is not that far back I'm just joking but right here do you understand that this is negative INF if you divide by posi infinity or negative Infinity what do you get either way so this part is really tending to zero are you clear okay how about e to thex where X is getting really close to zero how much is this little piece going to go to one just this just the negative X how much is that plug in zero how much do you get one one okay so e to thex this this piece is going to be one that's right because when we get really close to zero e to the 0 is one so we're going to have that if you look back at um e to X when you get close to zero when X gets close to zero how much is our function that so e x would be even still because we're doing zero we've got one there so this is going to give us one show Answer beated with that one fantastic so we know that our let's talk about this now on the numerator we have e to the Z everybody how much is e to the Z good over two does two change plus we have cosine pi cosine Pi we should know cosine Pi how much is it right 2 +1 so all said and done we've got 1 over 2 + 1 how much is our answer that's it that's how you think about these things work little pieces if if you get infinity over infinity like we would have here you got to do something else so start dividing by either largest or the smallest power in the denominator it's negative so check that out um if you can think through the little pieces and and you get something like this one over a number that's Fant one over a number that's not zero that's fantastic just work on the little pieces you it's going to take some thinking okay this is not super super easy concept you really have to think about what's going on with with each of these little pieces have I explained this well enough for you guys to understand it chopan if I have you're okay with it all right now are you finally ready to do some calculus with these exponentials so far what you should know in this class is this you should know how to find derivatives of natural logorithm anding natural logarithm that's what you should know do you guys feel comfortable with that one that was the first homework we just talked about how to do inverses because then we could get to exponentials inverses of logarithms are exponentials well we've got to talk about how to find derivatives and integrals of exponentials now and that's what we're going to do literally right now and it's going to be so excited you're going to like this one I really think you I like this one this a cool okay so let's talk about derivatives first we'll go right to it how in the world do we find the derivative of e to X how in the world are we going to do that uh well I'll tell you this uh this formula it's actually pretty complicated so if we want to do the derivative of e to the X here's what you do you ready for it it's super it's it's super complicated so I want you to tattoo just like tattoo it on your arm or something so here you go the derivative of e x is e x super hard yeah awesome right I love this one you don't do anything with it it's really weird but what seriously did did you guys know that one already those of you had calculus 2 before you do but if you didn't then that's actually the derivative if you do the derivative of e x you get edx do you want a proof for that one yes super easy proof it's like a really beautifully easy proof so here it is um let's start off with the function itself quick proof yal edx okay there's our function well naturally we don't know any formulas for how to find the derivative edx so we're going to kind of invent one right now way that you invent a formula is to do something you know works so here I'm going to do logarithmic differentiation logarithmic differentiation which you did in your first homework said hey if you don't know what to do or you want to make things easier why don't you try taking Ln on both sides oh look at this this is pretty cool here I've got Ln y here oh what's this it's X because Ln of e to X is X we okay with that one yes no well this is pretty awesome now with logarithmic differentiation you knew that you do implicit so with implicit the derivative of Ln y treating y as a function of X is 1 y * m time dydx equals we'd have to take the derivative here as well what's the derivative of x do you remember with logarithmic differenti are you guys okay with that by the way we took a derivative DDX here we did DDX here we got one we got one over y because that is the derivative Ln l and y would be 1 over y but since it's a function of X you need chain rule hence the dydx after that what do we do sure we're trying to solve [Music] for so if I multiply both sides I get Dy DX = Y and if we if we can if we can we should change that back to the original function so how much was the original function let's look back over there y equals y I love man so what that says is the derivative of e x is actually e x it's pretty cool now we can extend this concept just a little bit with the chain rule chain rule happens in practically everything that we do uh if you don't just have one of these basic derivatives so if we want to extend this then we say suppose you're taking a derivative of e to some function of X listen carefully please so you get this down the first time if you want to take the derivative of e to some function of X it works exactly the same way you leave the original alone and then you multiply by the derivative of the inside just like the Ln derivative remember the one for Ln of whatever you had you put one over the function times derivative of the function do you remember that here you're just going to do the function times the derivative of the function if you like the F prime notation better uh you can write a little bit differently or if you want to see it with 's if you do uh a derivative of e to the U I think this is how a lot of books do it you would have what would you have yeah you you'd have the edu again and then you'd have du DX it's says the function itself times the derivative of the inside basically just the exponent part tell you what I'd like to practice a few of these things just to get our uh our brains around this but I think you'll find that they're fairly straightforward um you obviously need to know what the chain rule is you need to know what the product rule is you need to know all what your trigonometric functions are as far as derivers go but if you know those things this is just one more little piece of the puzzle for calculus so let's try a couple examples maybe two or three okay pretty straightforward question uh do we have chain rule or not here what do you think unless it looks exactly like this then yeah you got a chain rule so unless it looks exactly like something on your uh differentiation table Yeah chain roll for sure so here we got chain roll tell me the first thing that I would write what would I write first e to when we're taking derivatives of these exponentials you don't change the function at first the Dera of e x is e x so the derivative of e x Cub is e x Cub but this acts like your U so do not forget to do what next chain Ru that's right the derivative of can you guys do the derivative ofx Cub that's a piece of cake so we have e tox Cub time what' you say it was 3 it's typically appropriate to write this part first so we'd have - 3x^2 e tox cub okay I want a quick show of hands you feel okay with with that one good do you guys see how this is just one more thing that we have it's still a chain rule but it's just one more rule that we have for derivatives e to the X derivative of that is e to X let's do that it's often helpful to Think Through what rules you're going to need before you actually start on your derivative so let's think about this one X2 e to -2X uh what's the first thing that you should be thinking about in this problem what do you think yeah immediately we see well the thing that holds these together is a product so we're going to need the product rule why don't you guys go ahead and write the product rule I'm going to write up on the board but I want you to practice on your own right now let's check your work and my work do you guys have roughly the same thing these of course can be reversed did you take the derivative of the first one times the second at some place and the Der of the second one times the first at some place fantastic okay now you can help me out with it derivative of x what is that so we get 2x do we change this one right now e -2X perfect plus do we to do a derivative of this one no this is just X2 can you do a derivative of e to -2X let's see if you got it right this should be well that's a chain rule within our product rule here was product rule uh where where am I product rule here that's a chain rule inside of it so we'll have our X2 we'll have our e to the -2X notice we do not change that function at all the first time it's just e to -2X times the derivative of -2X if you find yourself being off by constants by signs a lot like man where is that coming from you're probably missing the chain rule don't forget about the chain rule in these things it is huge what is that derivative anyway so 2x e -2X this would be - 2x 2 e -2X if you got that did you get that so we did it right do you see where the -2 is coming from so this is our -2 we got X2 we got e to -2X tell me one more thing that we could do here say it again coms combine no because we don't have any like terms Factor we can factor for sure we factor out a two we can factor out an X we can factor out an e to the2x this happens a lot with your exponentials because you get this repeating term over and over and over again because every time you take a derivative of e you get it back so we get these these factorizations a lot where we factor out the E so we get a two we get an X we get an e to -2X and if we factor that this becomes 1 - x okay I want to show if hand feel okay with that one you ready try one that's a little bit more tricky yes no okay little more tricky I'm going to have you do most of the work on this I'll help you with the first step so I would like to take the derivative of y = Ln e to the < TK X+ e to the < TK X and you're going what seriously yeah let's do it so I want to do the derivative of this nasty thing let's talk about the first step together what's the first thing that we're going to want to conquer here are we going to start taking derivatives of these guys right now what are we going to start taking derivatives of right now very good do you know how to take the derivative of Ln yes so tell me the first thing I have when I take the derivative of this thing oh I hope that you know derivative of Ln says you do what one original overide good not this right but just the inside so e to the < TK X Plus e to theun X quick head not if you're okay with that so far okay good are we done right now no no unfortunately not that'd be awesome if we were but what do we have to do take this chain rule all the time chain rule so what we're going to do is take the derivative of what's what do we take the Dera of this part yeah that's right Eun X Plus e theun x okay I want to get you started off on this one what's the first thing you're going to have to do in order to take the derivative of these pieces natural log natural log no not natural log because we're taking derivatives here we should know the derivative but I want you to change this a little bit before you start taking derivatives pieces restate it he said how do you restate it what do square roots become okay so off to the side over here so I'm going to do a little sidebar for just this piece we're going to find the derivative of e to the 12 power of X Plus e to thex to 12 we okay with that I want you to do these derivatives use your chain rules here and do both derivatives notice it's not like a product rule it's nothing hard take the derivative of this piece take a derivative of this [Applause] piece for this did you get him I hope so I hope so too let's see if you got them so first thing I would do I would do this one I do the chain rule on it so the chain rule says that I leave it alone I multiply by the derivative of whatever that function is of X so X to the2 show up hands if you made it at least that far I want at least that because you recognize your chain rule did you recognize your chain rule yes yeah okay so plus I I leave it alone I leave it alone so what chain rule says leave it alone multiply by derivative of your function of X your exponent did you make it that far okay these things are not so bad so we have e to the X sorry e to the U X2 time you know you know how to take those derivatives don't you this is a 12 X-2 this is a 12 x to the- 12 all we got to do let's make this into one fraction CU right now it looks really nasty what I want to know is did you make it this far on your own how many people did that's good if you didn't does this make sense to you hello know what do you think yes this is chain rule right alone dtive the inside 12 x^2 alone derivative of the inside - one2 you get the negative X to the2 so far so good okay well if you look at these These are both negative exponents we got a couple terms here but we can write e to x to the 12 over 2 < tkx let's verify that for me two's on the denominator x to the - one2 is on the denominator the 1/2 becomes a square root so far so good okay that changes this to a e the X2 over same thing happens here we've got two we've got a square root of x on the denominator yes no okay lastly do we have a common denominator that's great we can make one fraction out of it so this negative made that to a minus this is our two this is our square root of x right down there in the denominator now we're going to combine these tell me what's on our denominator please on the numerator do some Fancy Pants math I'm change it back to square roots so we got e to the x e to theun X you okay with that one minus right e x okay we're almost done I want to know if you're still with me are you still with me okay almost done what we're going to do now is we took this piece and did like a little little side trip over here so we're going to take this piece times whatever we ended with so yeah don't forget about that right so one over nasty stuff times even more nasty stuff equals the best nasty Stu our answer so here's what we got we got here's here our our derivative this is via the chain rule right here we had the original this is via the Ln the Der Ln so now we're going to put together what we end with is e to < TK x- e to theun X all over 2 < TK x e < TK X Plus e theun x it looks bad but that's our answer do you see where all the pieces are coming from we got our 2x right there we got this part here we get this coming from there can I simplify anything here in here can I simplify this you out like top bottom or E to X yeah you could you could probably do that it's not going to make it look a whole lot better but you could do that I'm talking about can I simplify this right now if you wanted to factor Michael you could do that fact a little bit out but for right here that's what I'm talking about show feel okay with that one okay before we go I want to talk we're not going to do these but I want to talk through them okay I want to see if you can understand the main concept behind each of these starting with this one with that one what would you do for what would your first piece that you would write [Music] be okay so the first piece would be leave this thing alone do you see that and then you'd have the derivative of what would you do for this that's a product rule that's right so you have this piece and then times a derivative that involves a product rule are you with me on that one okay this one what oh this should be an easy one for us what's our first step here five goes down do I change the inside this becomes a times the derivative of this junk and you're going to have a couple chain rules in there do you guys see the chain rules so you're going to have a two you're going to have A3 they'll change that sign here oh this is a good one this is a nasty one uh what's the first thing chain R product rule here so product rule we'd have derivative of the first * the second plus the first * the D of the second uh if you want let's see if I can do this real quick uh this will be e thex tan E X plus this will be e thex see s e x * e x and I believe those go away because you add exponents X Plus X gives you 0 e0 be one I think that's your answer I'll double check that and make sure that it's right uh but does today make sense did today make sense for you all right so we're going to continue we talked about how to do derivatives of edx and we've done a lot of them now we're going to start talking about to do integrals involving e to X and what we can what we can do with that now if you remember from last time what is the derivative of e to the X yeah it was like the easiest one ever well if that's the case if the derivative of e to the x is e to X then um the integral of e DX is what e yeah it's it's it's e DX if the Der is e DX the integral of e DX is e tox and of course yeah we do have to have the plus C here's what that means uh when we see integral of e x it's super easy you just put e to the X and you are done the integral e to X is e to X plus C now of course when we do this we're going to have a lot of chances to do substitution so we're going to have a lot of cases where it's not simply e to the X it's like e to the 3x or e to the X2 X x e to x s something like that where we can do a lot of substitutions so in this section you're going to have a lot of substitutions to do so we're going to practice a few right now uh to see if we can get the hang of are you ready you okay we'll start real simple what I've been telling you is that unless your integral f fits perfectly into your integration table which this is now one more integral that we can do unless it fits perfectly you're probably going to do some sort of a substitution for right now later on we'll have integration by parts or we have trigonometric substitutions things like that but for right now all we know how to do is if it fits perfect you do it if it doesn't fit perfect you manipulate it somehow and one way we can manipulate it is with a substitution can we do a substitution here what do you think substitutions are typically the inside of function so in this case it would be the exponent and the derivative has to be somewhere in the integral disregarding the constants so will a substitution work let's try one what would you pick for a substitution notice we're not going to pick e to 2x because when you take the derivative of e it pops back up again does that make sense so you'd have to have another E to 2x in there to simplify that we don't have that so if we pick U = let's just try the 2x what's the derivative of 2x 2 DX or du over 2 = DX okay tell me how this changes instead of e 2x I'm going to have e to the U perfect instead of DX I'm going to have du over two what can I do with that two and what's it become 12 so then this becomes 12 well let's look at it did it work did we get rid of all the x's and have only use left are you guys awake today did we get rid of all the x's and have only U left how that turn it was magic don't worry I'm Change magic math how about that one better our U matches our U so we know that we're correct also did we change this into something in our integration table can we do that now that's the idea of a substitution so now that we do this we leave the one 12 alone we get what e u the integral of e VI is nice and then there's one more thing we're deal with the plus C and just a bit there's one more thing I want to do here very good if you start with x's you better give me X's here so if we start with X we need this in terms of X so we can do 12 e to 2X then we put a plus c okay I want to see if you're okay with that are you guys okay with that yeah it's the simplest one that I can think of uh we just do a substitution substitution just a constant no problem integral of e to is e to question is it always going to work like that where you can theoretically just pull the two and take the up front if that's just like a 3X yeah absolutely this going to be 1/3 if that's a 7x it'll be 17 now of course you're not going to get them that easy all right so if that's the case sure by all means that's exactly the thing because we'd have to do a substitution anyway most of the ones we're going to deal with are probably stuff that looks like this this one granted is probably not so easy to do in your head it it doesn't follow this pattern exactly so we're not going to be able to do that really easy but the idea is the same the idea is try to make this fit your integration table does this fit our integration table the way it is right now not even not even close so we're going to have to manipulate we're going to have to find some substitution let's think about the substitution right now okay think this through should I pick this entire e to the 2x as my substitution no no because I'm going to get that back again remember the derivative you always get the e to the function back again so we'd get this e to 2x back again I don't see that anywhere so it's not going to it's not going to simplify that would be a problem are you guys with me on that okay is that a good substitution the X squ the derivative of this is 2x do you see a 2X anywhere also if even if that was there would it possibly get rid of this and that would be a problem i' have U's and X's you can't have that so what's the only other alternative if we can't pick the whole thing here we can't pick this thing what am I going to pick two yeah it's usually the inside of something so let's pick the the uh the U equal to 2x now I don't like seeing the two over the X so let's change that instead of 2 overx we can write that as 2 good we okay with that one so far our next step the substitution come on quickly next step is to do what so du equals how we take derivatives bring it down so that's -2 x to the -2 DX very good you guys okay with this so far yeah now if we do a little bit of manipulation you're going to see a couple nice things firstly that's a negative exponent which we typically don't like to have so if we have du we can set that equal to -2 over x^2 DX look back at your integral do you see that this thing's going to work yeah there's an x s here's an x s DX now I do things a little bit differently I like to solve for DX that's how I was ta so if I multiply both sides by X2 I get x^2 du if I divide by -2 it's over -2 equals DX let's see if that works I know we're still going to have an integral am I still going to have e to the 2x am I still going to have e yes absolutely I haven't substituted for that so I have an e what does the 2x change to that's our U is it still going to be over X2 well that depends on how you do your integral if you like to substitute uh this part right here for your du then no if you do it like I just have done it I'll switch back and forth to give you both aspects of this if you do it like I do it you'll have an x s here and instead of DX you'll now have X x^2 du over -2 does that make sense to you instead of DX I now have this piece for DX so instead of DX I have this in my case this is the way I like to do it because I can see stuff cross out I like to make sure my constants are all there uh that's just personally my preference you can do it a different way if you'd like to do my X squ simplify yes fantastic as soon as you see that you oh that's so nice I only have 's it's it's a du integral so we're good to go tell me something I can do with this -2 so i'm- 12 integral e u du can we do the integral of e to U yes yeah that's easy what's the integral of e to U so we're going to have -2 e to the U plus c plus c for sure there's one thing I'm going to do before I put put my plus C so I know that I'm not done I'm going to resubstitute in for that U so how much is our u 2 so we have -2 e 2x plus C that's the whole idea so P feel okay with the whole idea how can you check your work what do you mean go backwards be more specific take the do the derivative if you wanted to do the derivative you certainly could do it just do that one okay well if you had dtive of this piece is going to come back isn't it so Dera of this chain rule says go at 2 x to1 and bring down the 1 the negatives would go away the twoos would go away this would be X to uh -2 that would be overx S so we know that we're right on this one show up hands feel okay with that example it's a little more complicated right but can you do it just a substitution try these substitutions you're going to have a lot of them you guys want a couple more is this helping you at all hey let's think hard about this one firstly does this fit our integration table exactly the way it is no no it's not even close oh here's a good question for you guys who uh love algebra so much can I split up this fraction 19 no you can't split up denominators you could split up numerators but not denominators so we can't split this so we're going have to we're going to have to attack it directly now the only way we can attack this thing is with a substitution if it doesn't fit our integration model we need to substitute let's pick out a good substitution for this one would a good substitution be this e to thex no no if I pick this one the derivative is negative e tox but it won't cross this one out because that's connected with our plus does that make sense yeah okay what's a how about just this e to the negative X where I want to pick that one no well same basic idea this one would get rid of this one but well what about the one so let's go ahead and that's actually might work a little bit but to make things a little bit easier for us what are we going to take take a whole thing that way we have a u here we know the integral of that's already be going to be so that's nice we don't have to do a double substitution to a single one if you picked this you'd have to substitute again later and we want to create as as little substitution as few substitutions as possible so if we take U equals 1 + e x and we take our derivative everybody what's our derivative of 1 Z that's kind of nice that's why we picked it here so that whole thing goes away we don't have to worry about 1 plus u and then do another substitution to get Ln now we have just you here that's what we're going to end up with how about the derivative of e to thex Let's do why don't you do that one on your own see if you can do that so write it out real quick so this of course is zero we all know that one find the derivative of that remember with derivatives of e to the x or e to a function of X we leave the function alone so the derivative is e to thex but I'll tell you something if you're off by constants a lot or you're off by man I don't know where this x is coming from you're probably forgetting the chain R here so what you need to make sure you do is with all these e all these e functions don't forget the chain rule so the chain rule says sure I'm going to keep the E tox but I'm going to multiply by the derivative what's the derivative ofx so du actually equals e tox DX is it going to work yeah do you see it do you see it in the integral check this out some of you guys were taught to do integrals this way do you see the E to X DX up here y you can do that substitution pull the negative over here this is going to equal negative du if you know how to do integrals that way do it that way don't care if you learn how to do them like I did you can solve for it and now we can do our substitution so why don't you tell me just left side people you guys over here tell me please what is on the top of my inte depends on the way do it for the way I'm doing it what's on the top of my integral right now mm how about on the bottom of my integral what am I going to have there you can say it out loud and here I'm going to have du over e tox I'm substituting instead of DX I now have du overx so instead of DX I'm doing my substitution this stays this becomes a u and now we get to cross those out we can simplify e thex is gone tell me one thing I'm going to do before I start my integral yeah let's do that so this becomes the negative integral of what's inside there one U oh how about that look at that can you do the integral of one over U you can how much is the integral one over u l absolute value U perfect I like the absolute value so negative Ln absolute value of U I'm going to put a plus c after I make sure that I substitute back in there I don't want to put a plus c and then go oh I'm done I you don't want to do that okay if you want to put the plus C now you can uh but I like to do it later just so I don't forget that this was in terms of X I don't want to leave it in terms of U that's not the idea here so instead of negative Ln absolute value U we put negative Ln absolute value of what's in there 1 e plus now we put it plus C please keep that absolute value unless you can get rid of it now I want you to look at that real careful one + e to thex can this ever be negative no okay so you can choose to leave it if you want to in my class but in the back of the book they're probably not going to have the absolute value they're probably going to have this Ln 1 + e x because the absolute values are Irrelevant in this case it can't be negative doesn't matter plus c did that one make sense to you okay yeah tell you what let's try we'll do one more together we'll talk about one more and then we're pretty much done with this section we'll move on are these easy medium or hard are they more understandable now are you starting to get the idea here man I I I bet you you guys are going be Pros to substitution after this I know you learned it in your last class but we use it so often it's just incredible we use it all the time until we get to chapter okay integral e tox see e oh my goodness that's nasty enough for you in the morning is it let's try to find this out is this a uh is this something that fits in our integration table the way it is right now no not even close I see a see that's kind of cool cuz we we now know the integral of secant that's fine and we know the integral of e tox but not all of it together if you if you forgot about this what you can and can't do what you can't do is just take the integral of each little piece you can't do that when they're multiplied together when they're added sure but not when they're multiplied so we're going to have to use a substitution to try to change this into something that fits our integration table let's talk about a substitution would a substitution be good for this e to thex if you picked it you'd get it back again but will this cross this out no this is the argument of an angle you cannot cross that out okay argument of se you can't cross that out would it be a good idea to take this entire thing as your substitution still remember that you have to do derivatives correct so the derivative of secant is secant tangent do you see a secant tangent anywhere up here no a bad choice what's the appropriate choice for our substitution here the the E tox inside the SEC yeah that's the appropriate one if we pick this one we just dealt with this so I'm not going to bore you with asking you again the derivative of e to thex is e to thex DX uh again do you understand where the negative is coming from tell me where that comes from please R perfect chain rule okay so hey is it going to work yeah this is this piece we can make a substitution if you like doing it this way if you like doing that substitution here's one way you can uh you can solve for it so a different just a different method of showing this put the negative over here so negative du any constants over here and the substantial portion of your substitution here this piece is this piece this now these together become negative du do you guys see that it's a different way to think about that so here's an integral if I do my substitution tell me what's left on the inside of my integral please on the left hand side you guys what's what's in here still secant very good I like the see uh did you say U or e thex u okay and now if I take my e tox DX e tox DX all together becomes tell me what we're going to do with the negative the front so I'm going to move up here man we're almost done does it fit our integration table now yeah that's the whole idea of substitution is make it fit make it work I know it's going to be negative oh do you remember the integral of secant we did it a few classes definitely Ln which was kind of interesting when you think about it inside there should be secant U tangent U correct plus oh yeah sorry Plus close the absolute value tell me one more thing everybody we're going to do before we end this problem put your U Back In okay so negative Ln absolute value see what is our U anyway there we got breadcrumb Trail tell us what to do I'm going to put some parentheses there plus tangent e thex absolute value plus C sorry that's all scrunchy I got to fit it on the screen so negative Ln absolute value secant E X Plus tangent e thex and absolute value plus oh my gosh if you had that the first day of class kind of be crying now is it hard can you understand it at least yes it's doable you guys can do this you can if you can do a substitution you can do this we now know what derivative of e is we need to make sure we have chain rules that's going to give you a different sign up front if you forget the chain rule okay you need to remember that now we have substitution and we understand how to take derivatives we're good to go I'm going to talk about one more we're not going to finish this problem but I want to talk about it [Applause] you know one of the hardest parts for students is picking the appropriate substitution now of course if you pick the wrong one it should be apparent to you really quick but you waste time so let's think through what the appropriate substitution would be in this case and maybe you can try this one later at your own convenience uh you tell me good or bad this piece good or bad that' be bad because it's not going to cross out anything this piece good or bad this piece good well it would cross out this one and that but I'd still have X's right there that would be a problem won't get rid of everything does that make sense isn't that the same as that so both of them would be do you know how to do a lnu over youu me neither so let's make a different one well I can but it's a different different topic we haven't covered that yet okay how about this inside would that be a good choice if I did this one I'm going to get edx back again I'd have Ln U and I'd have an e over edx this would cross out this would not cross out you have to in with it this is your appropriate Choice your U here should be Ln e x + 1 and here's how I know that if I do the Ln e x + 1 look what Ln gives us back look if you take the derivative you're going to get one over this does that make sense yeah here's one over this and then you have a chain rule you're going to get edex back again here's edex back again if you do that use substitution this thing works out perfectly it's really easy okay so try that later uh try looking through that seeing that that is the correct substitution try that problem show hands if you feel okay on the stuff we've covered so far any question questions at all is it becoming easier for you I hope well get used to substitutions and it will it will become easier I promise now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to take this one step further instead of just doing derivatives and integrals that involve e to the X an exponential we're going to talk about exponentials in general where the base is not just e but where the bases any other number a constant for instance or even another function of that X so when we start section 6.4 we're going to discuss General exponential functions and general logarithmic functions instead of just dealing with e DX and lnx we're going to have any base to DX and a logarithm of any Bas besides
