Transcript for: Calculus 2 Lecture 8.1: Solving First Order Differential Equations By Separation of Variables
now we're moving on I think I told you before that we are going to do a little bit of differential equations right now this is not a class on differential equations this is a basic basic introduction uh some people ask me what are the applications to difference equations why in the world would we even use them I'm going to show you some of that right now what you need to know is that differential equations do have very far-reaching applications if you ever going into any sort of engineering uh so any branch of that you're going to be doing different equs for rest your life yay for you of course there are entire classes on differential equation several classes on it uh we are going to talk about one specific type of differen equations the easiest the most basic thank goodness for us uh separable differen equ separable separable differential equations so um here's what I'm not going to write all of this stuff down but these are kind of important little topics here side notes I said those are a better way to say it uh firstly a differential equation is a derivative with some unknown factor in it that we some something that we don't know um the order when we say uh differential equation of the order the order is the highest derivative that occurs so if we have a first order differential equation then we only have a first derivative in that differential equation does that make sense we had a second order that would be a second derivative in there did you guys get the idea so when we say order I will write this down so the order of a differential equation is the highest derivative that occurs in the equation let's let look right now at some first order differential equations tell me again what first order is going to mean for us just going to have the first derivative up there so first derivative and then then the function itself so here's a simple way to look at it here's a simple way to look at it that right there is an example of a very very basic first order differential equation uh do you see what if there's a is there a derivative up there I see a derivative do you see a derivative what's dydx stand for what type of derivative the first hey look at there first derivative it's an equation it's equal to some function of X are you guys with me we've basically been doing differential equations this whole time and say hey here's a function equal here's a derivative equal to a function can I get back the function of Y well absolutely if I wanted to find what y was equal to I would just have to integrate F ofx DX does that make sense to you well that's we've been doing integrals this whole time anti-derivatives uh we've been solving some very basic first order differenti of equations so differential equation of first order says youve got some equation this is an equation it has at most a first derivative in it actually it has exactly a first derivative in it solve that first derivative solve it for whatever the function is this is the idea here so be okay on the basic basic idea now this is very simple of course you really get more advanced in this now the problem is here if you don't already notice this this uh this only works for functions that are completely in terms of X doesn't it so this was pretty easy when we had integral of something with X but if I had integral with something of X and Y well that would be a problem wouldn't it what in the world would I do then well we're going to discuss that right now on these differential equations so this this is a problem because this would only work for functions in terms of X only so good only for functions of x which is exactly what that is what if we had functions in terms of both X and [Applause] Y we'll consider this if we did that what we what we would be doing is we'd have a derivative and we'd have a function with both X and Y in it so we still have a first derivative hey look at that is it still a first order differential equation let's walk through it uh does is it an equation does it have a derivative yes what type of derivative so this would be a differential equation of the first order does that make sense to you that's all this means guys it's an equation has a first derivative in it now problem here is that well we're going to have some function with both x's and y's in there that's going to be an issue we're going to have to deal with and that's what why these separable differen equations are going to be quite easy for us I'll show you them in a minute um I'm hoping that I don't intimidate you too much with the vernacular before we actually get to examples you're going to find out that they what we're going to do do here is not super hard it's going to take advantage of all the stuff we've learned all right uh so don't let it intimidate you right now just kind of stick with the the theory behind it what's going on um we will get there eventually well then a solu solution would be this a solution would be well it would be some function y of X so we treat y as a function of X you remember implicit differentiation you guys remember that how sometimes we don't know what Y is explicitly but we still know it's a function of X that's kind of the idea here is that we're going to be solving for y as a function of X even if it's not explicitly defined so a solution here would be something that when I take a derivative of it it gives me back the function that I want here y = y of X is our solution So based on you know I should this on some interval so in other words yal y ofx means it's a solution because when I take a derivative of y ofx it gives me the specific function I'm looking for f of x sub y oh sorry X and Y that's that's the idea here now would you like to see an example real quick okay I think that's probably a good idea to clear all this this stuff up right now I'm not going to show you how to do your differential equations I'm going to show you how to check whether one's a solution or not so show that Y = X + 1+ c e x is a solution to Y Prime = y - x on negative Infinity to Infinity well golly G how in the world are we going to do that well first thing first things first do you understand that uh y Prime is the derivative with respect to X of Y do you guys get that okay or Y Prime is the derivative with respect to X of Y of X because they're they're basically the same thing that's what we have over here y equals y ofx well here's what we're going to do then what we're going to do is we're going to take a derivative of this thing this would give us a y Prime what we're going to see is if when we take a derivative of this thing it matches up to this thing that's basically all it is it's saying take a derivative see if it matches right here you guys with me on this one so let's start off with Y = X + 1 + c e x can you tell me what y Prime is do you guys know how to take some derivatives of course you do so what's the derivative of x what's the derivative of one perfect can you do the derivative of C * e x do you need a product rule for that c a Conant C is a constant no no so plus what so what now c x it's perfect that's exactly right you guys okay with this so far you sure so right now we have two things we have y Prime = 1 plus c e x that's coming from this guy and we have y Prime = y - x at y - x well let's see about this what we know can I can I kind of take a little bit of these few things and move them together for you check this out what we know is that y Prime now you know I'm start this way I'm going to say Y = X + 1 + c e x true okay if I subtract X from both sides oops If I subtract X from both sides here I get y - x what do I get here those would be gone one they do you see it do you see that it works right now it says well look at this this right here this was our y Prime that's what we started with this right here this is our other y Prime so basically what it says is I'm going to have arrows everywhere and I'm sorry about that I hate all the arrows but that's where it's coming from uh here's the idea the idea says well check it out if I take the derivative of this thing with respect to x what I ended up getting was this agreed if I look back at my function and I subtract X from it look back at my function and subtract X from it that gives me this y - x oh look at that my y - x is equal to my y Prime that's was our initial our initial expression up here well but also if I subtract X from this side I get 1 plus c e to X which is my y Prime from when I took my derivative Bas of it says the derivative that you get when you I'm sorry the derivative you get when you take this this derivative is equal to what we're looking for it basically says that this is a solution therefore y = 1 + sorry x + 1 + c e x is a solution to this yeah a little bit more about the vernacular here guys have any qu you probably don't even know if you have questions on this I want to make sure that you actually get the idea the idea here was simply proving that when I take a derivative of this it satisfies this condition this is the idea do you guys understand the basic idea behind it are you sure it's probably brand new for you you haven't seen it so I would expect if you have questions now would be a good time anything at all have I explained it well enough for you to understand it and it wouldn't matter what C would be no and we're going to talk about that right now actually that's a good seg thanks for the segue anyone ever wants to buy me an actual segue that would be cool too I don't know why I did this because it doesn't do that it goes you just yeah you just lean do we get extra credit yeah yeah there's like a new leaner kind of seg leaner it's like it's no like it's like it's called Walking that is classic it's not as big and bulky I guess a leaner segue I like that joke that was funny whoever said that okay so where we at um here's the deal A first order differential equation will have a solution with one arbitrary constant this right here is an arbitrary constant notice how I could plug in anything to this thing and it would still satisfy that still going to work that's the idea so this will have a solution with one arbitrary constant C hence this is called a general and this is called a general equation sorry General solution so for us we'd say that Y = X + 1 + c e x is a uh look at this look at this with me for a second how many constants do you have one constant well sorry uh one arbitrary constant this this is a constant I know that I misspoke a little bit but this is a fixed con constant this one does not change how many arbitrary constants do you have remember that plus C you put the end of every integral that's an arbitrary constant doesn't matter what it is you get the same thing right this is an arbitrary constant there's one of them so this right here is a general solution to this differential equation now you might be asking the question at least I did the first time well wait a minute um if there's a general solution can you ever have a specific solution what do you think if the C was a number if the C was a number so if the to make the c a number we have to have what's called an initial condition U now if you've taken a calculus one class before which I know you all have you've seen basic differential equations with initial conditions the basic differential equations I gave you were these ones in calculus one uh where you just did an integral basically and then you plugged in your initial condition you're like wow this is really easy yeah it's designed of easy at that level so basically here's the idea we have this idea of a general solution which has your your your arbitrary constant in there if we want a specific condition so or particular solution we need what's called an initial value an initial condition um by the way the general solution gives you a family of these integral curves it's a family of curves just like when you add C to the end of a integral you get a family of curves that satisfy that condition this is the idea here so for a particular solution we must have an initial value initial values look like this this is from from your calcul one days it hasn't changed initial values look like this they say why when you plug in some X some specific X that's the X knot or X subz gives you some y sub Z value they're actually specified numbers so it says Hey y of 0 = 7 or y of4 equals whatever it's going to be something specific that you can actually plug in so let me would you like to see how that actually works okay let me show you that so this gives you basically this this is what this says this makes your differential equation pass through a given point I'll say this again what you're getting here I think I went through it a little quickly anyway the first time what you're getting here for your general solution is a family of Curves a family of these integral curves basically you can plug in anything to see can't you can't you and it'll give you a different curve at least that's that's how it seems to me if I plug in one or I plug in seven it's going to give you something slightly different doesn't it so General solution gives you a family of Curves if we want one specific curve listen carefully here please if we want one specific curve then we have to make it pass through a point one point this is the point do you get the point so what this do so what this does is this makes the differential equation pass through x sub z y sub Z it makes it pass through a point listen to this if I take a family of Curves this is a family of Curves right here if I take a family of Curves and say hey here's all your infinite number of family of Curves okay and I say now I want you to pass through one point it has to be one specific curve after that you have all these curves that go like this all these well it's going to hit this point only once you're not going to cross over otherwise it wouldn't be in the same family of curve curves so to satisfy this initial value you're you're limiting this to one specific solution one specific curve show hands if you understand the idea here now let's take what we just did what this whole thing did and apply this initial value to it I'm going to try to show you exactly how this works so first thing in order to solve these differential equations with initial values let's look at this uh just from what we know okay this this thing right here is called a what first okay look at it what is it first order first ordera differential equation this is a first order differential equation are you guys okay with that one what's this initial value exactly right that's an initial value so we have a first order differential equation and we have an initial value if you're going to solve a first order differen of equation you got have a solution to it a general solution you have to have something to plug numbers in we don't just start plugging numbers in now that doesn't make any sense okay what we do is we have our our general solution now for here for this differential equation we knew that Y = X + 1 + c e x is the general solution so we had our first order differential equation we already knew a solution was kind of nice right we just checked it you guys with me on this one we just checked it we know it's a general solution well now we're given an initial value here's where you use your initial value as soon as you have your general solution to your to your differential equation and you have your initial value can you plug these numbers into this yes yes you can so y = x x + 1 + c e x well you better tell me what the x is here for my initial value so y of 0 equals z what's the X there there only one number right so either way you you go you're not going to get wrong uh but which zero is the x is a zero inside or outside this is the X this is the Y so what's X become Z what's y become notice how if you have a function of x's and y's and you plug in everything that has an X and A Y your constant will be the only thing that you have left to solve for does that make sense that's nice that's why initial values tell you what your constant is what your arbitrary constant is so uh what's this become 0 plus 0 sorry that was wrong 0al 0 + one the one's not going to change plus what c e to Z sure so differential equation no problem got to have a general solution got to have something to plug numbers into if I'm giving you numbers here you got to have something to plug them into you're initial value says hey take these values for X and Y respectively use them in your general solution to solve for C to solve for that arbitrary constant let's see if we can do it y was 0 x was 0 x was 0 simplify it 0 = 1 + C C * 1 very good this is one so we're going to have C how much is c equal to can you take this and now rewrite your general solution except without C and instead of C put your number in there yes yeah that's exactly what I'm asking you for so look what look what this does okay try to explain this to you one more time a general solution is a family cures because you can plug any number into that okay it's going to give you a different uh curve for every single number you plug in if I want to go through a specific point it's saying now you're limiting that family curves to one specific family and to solve that for that specific family you need to tell me what the C is go he that c that c is the only thing that's giving you different curves ain't it the X isn't the one's not the E to X isn't the C is so if I can find out what my C is I can say that well now the specific solution not the general solution but the specific solution is going to be exactly what the general solution is but going through one distinct and if we do that we go from the general to the specific saying yeah I know family but no no no I want you to go through one point that gives me one specific curve show hands if you understood what we were talking about today cool next time what we're going to talk about I'm going to give you a lot more examples on what we're going to be doing with these differential equations we'll talk about how in the world to solve separable differential equations right now um let's not get ahead of ourselves we really haven't done much okay I've defined what differential equation are we've shown that a that we had a solution but it was given to you we actually didn't find that solution did we no we shown and then we talked about what an initial value was how if I have a family of Curves cool I I have that General solution but if I want a specific curve I've got to go through a solid Point fixed Point that's the Y Sub 0 equals z or Y sub y of x sub 1 = y sub x 0 y Sub 0 is a specific point limits the number we have to one what we're going to do next time again is talk about separable action actually how to find this thing so that this stuff is possible you guys okay with that all right so today we're going to discover what a separable differential equation actually is what they look like and how to solve these separable differential equations so firstly what in the world is a separable differential equation well really it's a differential equation remember we're talking about first order so with a first derivative it's a differential equation that can be written as a product of two functions so when we say separable it means that we can basically like separate the variables into a product so something times something else so this happens when the differential equation can be written as a product of two functions more specifically those two functions should be in one in terms of of one variable and the other in terms of the other variable so one would be in terms of say x and one would be in terms of say why [Applause] so when we talk about a differential equation yeah we're talking about an equation with a derivative in there when we're talking about first order differential equations that derivative has to be the first derivative when we're talking about separable differential equations we're talking about one of those first order differential equations for us where we can write that differential equation as a product of two functions one in terms of like X the other in terms of Y that's basically about it uh let me give you specifically what we're talking about if if we have a separable difference of the equation one of these two cases will be true either we can write it as dydx our first derivative is a function of X time a function of Y here's what we mean by separable separable means that do you guys see what we're talking about these two functions the ones in terms of X On's in terms of Y here we have a function of x times a function of why it's a product or if you do a little bit of math magic with this you can also get a different format or basically if we divide here multiply by DX over here and then subtract one from the other add one from the other we could get this a function of X plus a function of Y you can show that these two things are equivalent so I know I said a product of another but you should you need to know that you can take this and write it this way so we could take this by doing a little bit of math with it you can change this format into this format or vice versa show hands feel okay with these two two formats so this is what separable means basically says okay we have a function of x times a function of Y or we have a function of X DX plus a function of Y Dy just caught it I I like X's can't blame me d y right now we're not going to work with these things but I want to give you examples about what is separable what is non-separable okay so here's some some separable differenti of equations so if we take a look at uh these two examples if I were to give you x^2 + 1 DX + 1 y d y = 0 that right there would count as a separable differential equations you see that it fits one of these formats it's not the product one because we don't have a dydx equals something being multiplied together but it is this one it's a function of X are there any y's over here or any dys over here that's what we're looking for are there any x's over here or any DXs over here that's what we're looking for so that we can separate them into two different groups either by a product or a sum or difference you guys okay with that one this counts as a separable differential equation or something like this even something so basic As dydx and we're going to work with this one later equals K * y that right there is something that's uh directly proportional we're going to talk about proportionality in just a little bit one application of this well if you think about that we have what is this K why it's a product yeah it's a product so we could Define K as being a function oh you know what let me change this uh let me change this to a t because we're we're going to be relating this to time we could change this to K is a function of time where K could change with respect to time and Y would be some function in terms of Y so we could have two different functions out of this thing K being a function of time y being a different function with respect to another variable uh we're going to deal with this in just a little while but what I want you to notice is that these two things are actually separable difference equations all X's all y's a function of t a function of Y this is the idea show hands feel okay with the idea it's probably going to clear it up if I give you some non-separable as well so these are separable differential equations of course we have some ones that are non-separable so for instance if I had Dy DX equals that one something like that we have X Y2 right here look it separable or nonseparable separable for sure because it's x * y^2 no problem I can isolate my x's and my y's by doing just a little bit of division so basically I could divide over y^2 I could multiply DX over here and I'd have y's on one side and I'd have x's on the other side that's the idea that's what seable means we have we can get y's on one side x is on the other side quick head on if you're okay with that one so that's what you can do here if I just divided by y multip by DX or if I just added or subtracted one of these two things I'd have them on completely different or separate sides of my equation that's our separable differenti equations so far so good this one you can't do that with if I add a two if I add two well that's that's a problem I can't get these two things to to work nicely with each other or if I do something like this also not okay we have x's and y's together we can't separate those things show fans feel okay with with this you know what uh yeah there that's even more clear just so you know person I wasn't sure maybe made a tech on that uh definitely nonseparable so we have separable no problem we have nonseparable now what I'd like to do is do a couple examples of how to solve these things just so we get our feet wet with it so we're going to talk about right now how to solve our separable differenti equations so let's suppose we start with something looks like that how in the world are we going to do this well the idea is what we want is we want to have all of our x's and DXs on one side and all our y's and dys on the other side so basically if I have dydx = G ofx * h of Y well this right here this means it's separable because I can get all my y's on one side all my x's on the other side hence we can separate those variables so this is how to solve differential equations by separation of variables how would I move these things around what would I need to do to get all my X is on the right hand side and all my Y is on the left hand side what would I do just div by what take your take my P I want my x's on my right hand side sure so if I divide this I would get one over h of Y Dy DX equals GX we okay with that one now here's what's very interesting about this as soon as we have this our y's are on one side or X on the other side we can actually do whatever we want to an equation do you believe that you can do whatever you want to an equation as long as you do it to both sides what we're going to do is we're going to integrate right now on both sides of our equation with respect to X so we're going to have an integral 1/ h of Y dydx with respect to x equals the integral G ofx DX so maybe I can write a different color so you see what I'm doing here this same thing yeah we're going to integrate with respect to X X we're going to integrate with respect to X you see that I did the same thing on both sides what's interesting about doing this our DXs they're gone what that does that changes us into an integral of 1/ H of Y with respect to Y integral G of X with respect to X you guys okay with that so far now suppose that this is an integrable function if this is true what we're going to get here is we're going to get some function we're going to call it capital H cuz I don't know what it's going to be but it's going to be a different function because it's integrating remember doing that with anti-derivatives us capital letters from a long time back well if this is integrable then our integration is going to be H but is going to be a function in terms of Y you agree with that well this is going to be some function with respect to X plus some arbitrary constant that's basically how we're going to solve these things we're going to get all of our y's on one side we're going to get all of our x's on the other side and then we're simply going to integrate this is the whole idea do you guys understand the idea here let me do like a 20 second recap to make sure that we got this so the the brand of differential equations we're working with they're called separable they're called separable because they fit into one of these two categories saying I can group all my x's and all my y's on one side or the other they're not combined together when we can't do that where we can't separate our x's on one side and y's on the other you guys okay with that so far yes no okay so when we have this idea of separation solving by separation of variables we're trying to get our y's on basically left hand side x on the right hand side doesn't really matter the sides this is just nice for solving it later then we integrate on both sides with respect to the same variable hence X here after that if this is an integrable function we can do this we can do this we have arbitrary constant and this would be a solution to our differential equation this is the whole plan now do you guys want to see this in action some actual examples here yes I'm guessing that we do CU this is I it's well it's clear to me but hopefully it's clear to you I know it's a little vague though we haven't really done anything yet so let's start any questions or anything at all okay so first one let's look at dydx equal YX you know the first thing we got to do is make sure this fit fits our category so let's see is it an equation oh yeah clearly is it a differential equation is it a first order differential equation what tells you it's a first order differential equation yeah it's what type of derivative hence we have a first order differential equation is it variables that can be separated do we have a separable differential equation where we can get our x's on one side and our y's on the other side all by themselves yeah very good it's it's a product really is a product of a function of y * a function of x if you think well minute that's a quotient all quotients are kind of products right because you just have y * 1 / X and you have yourself a function of y * a function of X now how would we get this to be the way that we want it I want my Y is on the left hand side when my X is on the right hand side what would I have to do if I divide by y that would work just fine so divided by y I get 1 over y Dy y DX = 1X not bad are all my functions of Y on one side and my function of X that's on the other side right now would be a perfect time to do what with this do you see why we have to have our integration techniques before we start this stuff because to undo a derivative well think about that to undo a derivative that's an anti-derivative that is the idea of an integral so our separation variable works really nicely because when we separate our variables on both sides we can integrate the left we can integrate the right and it undo this derivative this is the idea here it basically gives us back the function we're looking for so if hands feel okay with the basic idea so let's integrate both sides so if I integrate the left hand side it's going to be 1/ y Dy DX and then what what goes over here remember all those times that your instructor said you got to have the DX you got to have the Dy you got to have all that stuff you got you do have to have that it's really not a trivial thing you have to show me what you're doing what you're integrating with respect to because when we do this here we have to see that we've done the same thing on both sides of our equation otherwise we mess our problem up that's not that's not fun to mess our problem up here so what happens on the left hand side what are we going to havex is canel so we're going to have integral of one over y Dy we're going to have integral of 1 /x DX oh this is interesting one y Dy 1X DX do we know how to do those integrals okay everybody what's the integral of one y Dy of what perfect and what's the integral of 1x DX done plus c ah why don't we have two plus C's should we have a plus c over here as well you can but it just all goes together and that's right if it's an arbitrary constant it could be anything right so if I have a plus c from here and I have a plus c from here if I just subtract that I'd still have a plus c it'd still be some sort of a constant a constant plus or minus the constant is a constant you guys okay with that you sure I said constant a whole bunch of times uh so I'm going to put plus C but I'm going to do this with it I'm going to be a little bit special um the good special I'm going to write plus C1 and here's why we're going to do that we're going to be manipulating this for a little while and what we can do with our C here the idea is what we can do with that we can change it around to make it as long as it's still a constant value whatever we basically want to so it fits our our our solution better so here's the things I'm going to do with this the first thing I'm going to do first are you guys okay with this this far this is pretty straightforward right kind of an easier one first thing I'm going to do I'm going to let C1 equal Ln e to C1 I want you to verify that that's actually possible do you remember that's possible it's kind of arbitrary thing right uh any number equals Ln of e to that number because Ln and E well they they simplify out there that's a they're inverse functions of each other therefore this would also equal C1 by definition that's that happens you guys okay with that one now the reason why I'm doing this I've got an Ln here right I've got Ln here right I don't have an Ln here but I want one I want one because if I have one then I can use e to the Ln on both sides if I can combine these two things so my plan is well if that doesn't have an Ln I'm going to make it have an Ln then what I'm going to do is I'm going to combine these two LNS after that I'll have Ln over here I'll Ln over here I can take e to both side well both sides as an exponent on E and get rid of my LNS does that make sense to you guys so my plan is I'm trying to put these two things together let's work with our Conant in a certain way that we can do this now in order to put these together a little bit further I can't just have Ln of e I've got to have this absolute value up here too so I'm going to put my absolute value here now you can notice that this is a true statement because e to any power is positive anyway my absolute value is kind of trivial but it's going to allow me to combine these two things so P feel okay with with this one are you sure so this is the one spot you can't put plus C at the very very end that's right you kind of have to have breadcrumbs on what you've done with your constant um so some people do some people cheat just go ah plus C at the very very end but we we have to really know what's going on here sometimes it really doesn't matter so this is like our breadcrumbs what we've done to change our constant here the hard part is honestly not the integrals that's pretty easy uh it's it's figuring how to put this constant in there uh so that we get one nice solution with one arbitrary constant I'm going to do a couple of things with this are you okay with it I don't really like the look of this so here this is things we can do too I want to show you all this stuff you're like oh you can actually do it yeah you can well instead of having e to the C1 I'm going to let C2 equal e to the C1 I don't like this part of it it looks really funny to me and so here's the thing you guys all agreed with this one right well C1 equals Ln of e to C1 absolute value doesn't really make a difference is this still a constant is to a constant still a constant number well then I'm just going to call that a different constant notice how I'm using the the subscript now of C2 to say well it's not I don't want C okay because C that's what we're going to end with we're going to end with the c if I start with a c and end with a different C it's going to look funny so I call the C1 saying hey I'm going to change it okay I'm going to change it to a C2 saying this is not my final C but it still stands for a constant does that make sense to you guys are you sure okay so then what happens is that C1 now would become Ln absolute value of C2 this is what I want to use here so Ln absolute value Y no problem Ln absolute value of x no problem plus what's C1 what am I going to use there you are absolutely right sure so we say hey C1 no not so good I need an Ln I also need absolute value so it's changing C1 becomes Ln absolute value of e to C1 no problem is this still a constant yeah it's still a constant no big deal is this a constant sure let's call it a different constant we're saying let's define basically let's define C2 to be e to the C1 is still a const we're fine as far as our notation goes therefore C sub 1 equals Ln of absolute value C sub 2 we're going to write that right here the reason why we did this is do you know how to put Ln plus Ln together multiplication yeah very good and since we have absolute value times absolute value we get to multiply those things together so this becomes Ln absolute value of y equals why don't you tell me what it is Ln uhhuh absolute value absolute value X2 X C2 okay I like it x * C2 we know that plus means a product within one Ln so two LNS being multiplied together same base we can sorry added together we can multiply the product of these two arguments since they absolute value make one absolute value out of it click show hands you okay with that one I'm have to move over here so now we have Ln absolute value of y equal Ln absolute value x * C sub 2 can you tell me the next step that you guys would do if you had this problem what would you do say what now very good we'll take this and treat them as exponents upon e on both sides of our equation so you know that's what you do right every time you have Ln on both sides you go wait a minute I don't like Ln on both sides I want to do e to the Ln of absolute value of y and I want to do e to the Ln of f Val x + C * C2 what happens to that e to the Ln what happens so we get absolute value y still equals absolute value of x * C sub 2 are we still okay with that one is this where I want to do yeah where I want do this now I want you to think about something here uh the definition of what absolute value actually means I'm going to take a little side step so that hopefully you get the next part if the absolute value of y equal x what we end up getting is that y could equal postive x or y could equal x that's the definition of what absolute value is it could equal an absolute value equation is so sayy you know what if you have an absolute value something equal to a number here or whatever we can have well the inside P equal positive X absolute value keep it positive we're done or if we had Negative X absolute value of negative would change to a positive in either case these would both be true we get those two solutions for an absolute value so should be okay with that one we're going to write this just a little bit more simply then so we would say y would equal positive or negative X does that notation work for you guys doesn't matter it's it's absolute value says you can have either a positive or negative and that absolute value will keep that exactly the same whether it's positive or negative you guys with me using that logic over here this lets us drop our absolute value so what this says is okay well then if I have absolute value of y equal absolute value of x * C2 we'd have y = x * C2 for sure but we could have positive or negative and it would still work for us so y can equal positive X or negative X y here can equal positive x * C2 or x * C2 sure F you okay with that one are you sure and that would get rid of both sides of the that's right that's right uh when you're doing absolute value equations we just need to treat one side as being positive or negative that there's really only two cases there's the case where the signs are the same both positive or both negative doesn't matter absolute value would change those negatives both into positives or the signs are different one's positive one's negative doesn't matter which which uh which side they are on so we don't need all four cases we just need two here's the two cases where they're both positive and where the or both negative and where the signs are off by one that's where we have the plus and we have the minus that's a good question any other questions about that before we go on you see we're almost done very close to done because multiplication is commutative we could do plus or minus C sub 2 * X you with me and here's the last thing as soon as you get it down to here where you have this nasty gobbly G up here this is what you define to be your arbitrary constant see here's the thing if I have positive c sub2 c sub2 is a number yes it's a number like three or I don't know what it is but it's going to be some number we could have positive C sub 2 or we could have negative C sub2 either way this is going to be a constant value does that Mak sense to you this is what we're going to Define to be our C so at this point we say hey let's let C = plus or minus C sub 2 if we do that that's an arbitrary constant and what that is is our solution to that particular differential equation that's called a general solution because we have that one arbitrary constant so we work with it no problem get your variables on one side or the other all y's all X's integrate that's how separation variables works not a big deal we all know how to integrate this class after that it's really working to figure out how you get rid of Ln see if you can solve for y explicitly and this is the plan for us if you can solve for y explicitly I expect you to do it can you always solve for y explicitly no sometimes you can't we're going to deal with a couple of those where you can't I'll show you what to do in those cases uh by sance you feel okay with with this idea feel okay with the content usually that some for some people that really throws them for Loop like what in the world are we doing well honestly it's just it's deal with a constant making sure that you fit it into your equation so that you can you can solve for your y so you can get your y by itself um as long as you don't make this into a variable or something you'd be fine so call this a different constant yeah it's a little different C2 equals e C1 no problem then we have all the way down to here take that plus and minus with our C2 call that your constant your arbitrary constant and we solve our problem and we don't ever have to go back and substitute it and find C1 again after going through C2 C3 or no if you do it this way if you do this correctly even with initial value problems you don't have to do that this is why we this is why though you have to Define it properly because otherwise you're going to be off by some things sometimes all right so no we we typically don't have to go back and and say what it was but you should be writing this off to the side like I don't want you to go all the way down to here and then go okay bam and not do not show me any of this stuff because that would basically be impossible right to just arbitrarily call it call this something but you got to Define it somewhere of what you're doing with your C1 or C2 can we try another example it's ready for it let's do this one what you think separable non-separable nonseparable is it a product of function of x times a product sorry times a function of Y yes always be you're the teacher you tell me I'm the teacher trying to get you to understand is that the same as what I just wrote on the board is that a product of x times a function of Y yes then that a separable differential equation even though it looks bad it's still a product of a function of x times a function of Y get the Y on one side and get the x's on the other side what are we going to do here so in our case we'd have one I don't want to lose you on this stuff do you guys see how to make this into a separable differential equation just right over it's just a product we have 1 over y dydx = x x^2 + 1 and that's it you okay with this one hello yes no are you sure do you guys see what I'm talking about being separable here separable means you can get all the x's on one side and a function of Y uh sorry all the Y's on one side and a function of X on the other side sure you okay with it let's keep going what's our next step let's do it sure let's integrate both sides not a big deal we can totally do that can you do both integrals sure this should be the easy part my goodness it's I'm not even kidding this is like the easy part of doing this not not even a problem uh let's let's move a little quick on this one what's this integral please Len what abue ah very good can you do that integral yeah is it a trick sub no make it easy on yourself what is it UB absolutely UB so Uub says that you would be what perfect du = 2x DX du/ 2 = x DX hey that's this right here not a problem so this would become the integral okay yes very good okay so one over U du over two see if I did that right did I do that right this is now our U okay I got that one uh X DX becomes D over2 no problem so 12 Ln absolute value U and now what change it back to X got to change it back to X I'm G do that right here so 12 Ln absolute value of x2+ one awesome and then plus sure C1 let's do C1 yeah let's do C1 okay you P feel okay with that so far good you should right because these are some very basic integrals um also if you want to be a little fancy about this and be like well you know what I know that this has an Ln and I know that this has an Ln and this one doesn't you can do things like this and go let's just call this Ln absolute value C1 let's just do that it's still a constant you see what I'm talking about you can do that if you want to go okay hey it's plus some constant I don't care what it is you might be you might do this if you want to be super notti I think I just made up a word uh but super notti about it and just go well then call this C2 if you really must then C1 would equal Ln absolute value of C2 does that make sense to you then you'd say okay well cool you'd have your C1 initially you'd say C1 C is equal to Ln of C2 second C and then just call that uh no still be oh sh I miss how we do it the first time this would be e to the C1 C2 E Yeah C2 = e the C1 C1 = Ln I know C so we go okay C1 now equal Ln absolute value C2 and you could Define it that way if you want to it's the same thing we've done before um do I need to explain that further for you are you guys okay with that one hon I don't want to blow anybody out of the water right now honestly are you okay with it so you start with no yes no some people are no but they don't want to admit it because you're like uh I have no idea what you're talking about right now let me go through it one more time do you understand that this integral is Ln absolute value y do you understand that this integral because we already did it is 12 Ln absolute value of x^2 + 1 yes no yes no okay okay and what do you always put at the end of your integral only here you're going to Define it a little bit differently it's going to be C sub one because we will be changing it how you define this well depends on what your equation looks like if I have an Ln here and I have an Ln here I'm probably going to want to combine this to one Ln if that's the case then we need to go through that process and say well this is definitely equal to this that's an arbitrary statement if you let C sub 2 equal e to the C sub 1 then this piece fits here C sub1 = Ln absolute value C sub 2 and this substitution is what we would make for the C1 the only reason why we're doing this is so that we can fit our Ln together so we can make this one expression in terms of a natural log an argument natural log show hands if that made a little bit more sense that time okay so Ln absolute value of y equals 12 Ln absolute value of x^2 + 1 plus Ln absolute value of C sub 2 yeah perfect now there's one thing you got to know about combining logarithms and the order in which you do it it's very important that you get this order I know on from your first test some of you don't have this order down do I combine my natural logarithms right now that's impossible the reason is because well it's not just a natural log plus natural log it's 12 time the natural log plus a natural log what do I need to do first the half the half's got to move in order for you to combine these logarithms by a a sum so this plus here this has to be gone what's that become so this would be a power of 1 12 what's a power of 1/2 that's a square root right there so then we have Ln absolute value y equals Ln absolute value square root x^2 + 1 plus Ln absolute value C sub2 have to move over here again so Ln absolute value Y no problem that's been there for a while now tell me what we get to do here after we move up the 1/2 so 1/2 is a power no problem 1 12 has an exponent exponent of2 is a square root what do we get to do now because we Define this we get to move our LNS together as one Ln so Ln absolute value of what time okay very good make sure we don't do something silly here please don't do something silly here don't do something like this oh yeah plus means plus y don't do that I'm begging you please don't do that your Ln rulle say no no no plus product and absolute value quick head down if you're okay with with that one so far you sure okay now what are we going to do come on now what are we going to do think back to the last example now what are we going to do power kind of yes raise both sides as a power upon e so we have these we go wait a minute I know I know as soon as I have an Ln equal to an Ln this is a beautiful thing this is exactly why we did all this stuff is to get an Ln equal to an Ln because if I have that I treat both of them as exponents of e nice what happens when you take e to an Ln power everything magically disappears and this becomes absolute value y equal absolute value of < TK x^2 + 1 * C sub 2 Okay show pans if you can make it that far on your own feel okay about that one is it going to take you some practice yes yeah probably is it making sense right now though for you yes are you sure are there any questions about this at all it always makes sense in class it does make sense in class I know usually typically I want to make sure that this does make sense for you though so I don't because if I'm losing you here I'm going to lose you on the next stuff we're doing I don't want to do that you guys get the idea of changing your constant how it doesn't really matter because we still have a constant you call whatever you want right you guys okay that we're doing that so that we can combine our Ln yeah yeah we're doing that because if you can combine your LNS to one Ln and another Ln and ex treat those as an exponent of e on both sides and we eliminate our Ln that's that's great we have just the argument equals the argument and now it's time to get rid of our absolute value you don't stop here you don't just drop your absolute value and call it C for some reason you got to show me what you're doing right so what we're doing here is we know that absolute value by the definition I gave you over here absolute value of y equals absolute value of something else is either plus this thing or minus this thing positive or negative would still give us the same answer because those absolute values will take care of those different cases for us where our signs are the same both positive or negative where our signs are different one positive one negative does that make sense to you see so think back to the last example we did EX the same now last little bit what are we going to do here cuz I don't like this I don't like this at all I don't like this what are we going to do plusus to the c c instead of C2 so plus or minus C sub 2 < TK x^2 + 1 no problem I know how to do that true or false this right here no matter what I give you positive or negative and whatever C2 is true or false it will be a constant true call that call that your arbitrary constant so let c equal plus orus C sub two do you see pun intended uh why we use C1 to start with because we're going to end with a c does that make sense if we use C here this would be off so we we want to call it the same thing because it wouldn't it's not the same constant it's a different constant I don't care what it is because we can change this to whatever arbitrary concept we want to so this could change whatever arbitrary concept want to but it is a different technically constant so we have y = cunk x^2 + 1 and this is our general solution to our differential equation notice how General Solutions have how many constants in them one constant because I can combine all of them that's the idea so fans you feel okay with with this one we're going to start one more I don't know how far we're going to get on onto it but I want to give you an example of an initial value problem like a re real one one that you get beyond your your Calculus one class so let's solve this initial value uh differential equation and see how it differs a little bit from what we're doing we'll see some of this stuff come into play okay it looks kind of nasty let's see about this um what is this thing called initi do do I use it here this is basically used look at the board when you get to here this is where you use it you define all the stuff all the C's and stuff so that you can use it here without a problem this is the idea right so our plan for this problem deal with your differential equation make sure it's separable make sure that you can actually do it and then at the very end we're going to use our initial value with it so we're going to ignore this for a second we're going to look right here at this thing is that a separable differential equation yes if you can make it to a product times a product oh sorry not a product that's silly if you can make it a function of X time a function of Y or you can get all your xes on one side and all your y's on the other side and be able to do those integrals then yes that's separable so for us let's start with what would I do move the the Yus one to the right side I'm I might choose to leave this one on left for reason I might choose to move this one over very good so we'd have y^2 -1 Dy equals yeah y e x DX you guys okay with that one so far yeah furthermore keep on going what am I going to do now y yeah so if I do that or leave the it doesn't really matter as long as you get the Y over here in fact I might choose to leave the the negative on that side what now yeah you can Mo the DX to be really proficient with our our variables here and what our our notation is you can move your DX right here now naturally everybody's going to know that if you do that and you integrate you're going to put a DX right back over here right and this DX should be gone so if you don't want to show that I don't know if I showed it on mine uh yeah I did I showed it CU I'm I'm really to the by the book on most of this stuff so yeah I would probably move this over here and show y^2 - 1 y Dy DX = e x yes now we do what inte so if we do we'll integrate with respect to DX or S with respect to X we'll integrate with respect to the same thing DXs are gone integral y^2 - 1 y d y = integral e tox DX let's keep on rolling what are you going to do now let's do the easy one first can you integrate this side that's a piece of cake what's integral of netive e tox DX I love integrals of e tox so we know on on our right hand side we're going to getx what's going to have to happen here what is this how would you guys do this one don't make it harder than it is you sub would not work Y is on the denominator it's not on the numerator split it into two split it into two fractions very good because if you do that if you split this then what this becomes is the integral of look at this look at don't make it harder make it easy this is what you learn in calculus one is to if you don't know how to do it directly you try to separate the fractions this would be y - 1 y you guys okay with what I'm doing there actually what Charles was doing there he says Hey separate it we got a numerator with two terms on it denominator one we can always separate that fraction have y^2 over y y^2 y is y - one over y - 1 one no problem can you do that integral can you do this integral piece of cake let's do it together and then we'll we'll come back to this problem just a minute okay so what's the integral of uh y minus perfect equals we'll do one more step and we'll call it good and then after that we'll um you know we're almost you guys want to hang out for like a minute and finish this thing yeah okay one thing I'd probably do here I'd probably multiply everything by two I'd do that to get rid of that2 just to make it look nicer so if I multiply everything by two we're going to get y^ 2 - 2 Ln absolute value of y = -2 e x + 2 C1 I want to make sure you guys are good with with that one are you good with that one sure you're good with that one okay next thing we'd probably do um well probably move that too so we'd get y^2 minus Ln of y^2 = -2 e x + here's where we we start doing little substitutions if you have 2 C1 2 * a constant is still a if you want to Define things like C2 = 2 * C1 that's absolutely fine then this now becomes plus C2 so integral no problem integral no problem plus C1 okay cool multiply everything by two just to get rid of this fraction we got y^2 - 2 Ln y = 2 and then plus 2 C1 that 2 C1 call that a different constant just to make your life easier does it matter not really but it makes your life easier later because you don't have to worry about that too so this now becomes C2 it's still a constant who cares about that you guys okay with this one so far okay now at this point this is where you plug in your initial value notice there's no freaking way in the world that you were going to get y by itself here do you see that no there's not all LNS you can't get y y explicitly so this is where we use that initial value we say y of 0 = 1 now tell me what would our X become here One X what would our X become what would our y become so if that's the case we get 1^ 2 - Ln of 1 = -2 e to 0 + C2 Plus C2 she feel okay with with that so far this is the easy part this is really nice how much is 1 s how much is Ln 1 equals how much is e to Z 1 * -2 plus C2 and can I solve for C2 see the idea is right now what we have here look at the board this is a general solution if we called that c we'd have a general solution to this differential equation with an initial value problem it says okay Now find out how much the C is actually equal to I don't care whether it's C1 or C2 or C3 po we're going to go ahead and plug that was funny we're going to plug that in we're going to find out what so we're going to have C2 I should I should have made a C3 that would been good do you understand that I don't care what C it is whether I call this uh 2 C1 it does doesn't really matter um we're going to get the same exact thing here C2 whatever you define that as is going to be three what that means that our specific solution our particular solution to our given differential equation with our initial value is now that that's the idea so we solve our differential equation just like normal all the way down to where we have an arbitrary constant just like just like always then we plug in our initial value and we just use it Sol for your c as soon as you get your C check it out as soon as you get your C sub 2 or C sub whatever you have that's what we put in that place and now we have no arbitrary concept we have our general I'm sorry we have our particular solution so feel okay about that one hey okay all right so let's continue uh the last thing we're going to talk about in section 8.1 is natural growth and Decay and how this differential equation idea at least by separation of variables works for us so natural growth or decay what we mean by that is either growth or Decay at a rate that's proportional to the size of a given population so for instance uh you can maybe think about this in terms of growing populations for bacteria or people or other species or a decline of population uh or like a half-life of sub you guys know what halflife is yeah halflife is of Sub sub substance that's a natural growth or Decay model so we're going to study natural growth or Decay again what it means it's a growth or Decay at a rate that's proportional to the size of a population and we're going to study all about this today now when we talk about directly proportional this is actually kind of an algebra idea if we have something that is proportional really what we have is y = k * some variable so if y stands for our population size and T is time then our K is going to be some sort of a A variation model it's either going to grow this population or decline this population based on what we have for this does that make sense to you so this is our this is what directly proportional actually means so y = k * t means directly proportional well well if we were to take a derivative of this here's what would happen if we take a derivative and find out the rate of our growth or Decay so think about this if this is our population if this is our population model you guys with me on this this is our population model if we take a derivative a derivative gives us a rate of change does that make sense you should learn that from Rec calculus one class since a derivative is a rate of change a derivative of a population would be how that population is growing the change in our population so if we take a derivative we'd have Dy DT it would be respect to time equals K time Y where Y is a function of time so this would be a derivative of sorry this would be a derivative with of um population with respect to time so we say all right cool um here here's our population with respect to time if we take a derivative of this we get the rate at which our population is changing with respect to time whether it's growing growth or whether it's decaying loss does that make sense to you so we take a dri go cool what we're going to get out of this is we're going to get some sort of a con a constant variation times Y where Y is a function of t a population changes over time so this would be the rate at which our population is changing now what if K is positive what's going to happen oh is our population going to grow or Decay so for K is greater than zero what this is going to be for us is going to be a population growth well naturally if K is less than zero we're going to get decay now I want to take a look at the model of this what we're going to do right here is we're going to solve a differential equation once and for all for natural growth or Decay would you like to do that rather than every single time we're going to have a model for this okay so we're going to solve this model and then I'm going to show you how to apply this to a variety of situations so first things first so let's say that we have this very basic differential equation that we started with right here K * y well that's this what we know is that a derivative of y with respect to time right now this is going to be the rate at which our our population is changing either growing or decreasing decaying does that make sense to you guys so we're going to start with this differential equation notice it is a differential equation A first order differential equation and well let's look at that is it separable yes yeah we can get y's on one side no problem we could keep the K on one side and get the Y on the other side that would be not a problem at all so it is separable also what we're going to do is we're going to have some initial value here's what this is going to mean for us in terms of our population please listen carefully I want to make sure that you guys all get this because otherwise the next thing we're going like well why are we doing this what's what's this even for population is directly proportional to the size that some sort sorry is directly proportional and it's based on time this is the rate of change of our population okay cool we got that we get the rate of a change of population our population has to start somewhere doesn't it so if this is population based on time at Time Zero we're going to have some sort of a starting population here so when we're not going to have negative time does negative time make sense to us makes sense okay unless we go backwards in Time time travel I don't know we're not in physics class so we're not going talk about that here okay so uh what we have unfortunately for some of you I know you're sad right now uh for us right now we're going to have a starting time of zero sure at the starting time of zero we are going to have some initial population this is what this stands for so this right here for us is going to be our starting population please keep that in mind when we're going through here that y Sub 0 is the starting population when Tal so when T equals z that's means when you start it means no time has passed hey when no time has passed you were going to start with some amount of population right if you don't otherwise your population can't grow you have to start with something or or it has to Decay from somewhere so this right here stands for a starting population I was going to say one more thing but I completely forgot about that so initial value starting population let's go ahead and let's see if we can solve this thing like we normally would so remember how we solve any difference of equation the first thing that we do is we find our general solution you guys remember that with one arbitrary constant we did that last time and then what we do is we use our initial value to find a particular solution to this make sense so what right now we're going to take this off this side we're going to work just with this thing so Dy DT = KY at this point you guys should be pretty good at doing this sort of thing why don't you tell me what I'm going to do here move the Y very good why you your y on one side yeah very good take so instead of having KY here I want just the K on one side I want just the Y on the other side so we'd have one of Y Dy DT equals k so far so good hey it's separable let's separate the variables no big deal um K is going to be well it's going to turn out that K is going to be uh something based on timee as well so we're going to we're going to integrate this with respect to time as well so well now we did this last time we said okay well as soon as you have your variable separated we take an integral with respect to whatever this thing is so with respect to time here so in our case we'll have all right cool integral of 1 y dydt DT equals integral of K DT okay this should be pretty straightforward but I want to make sure your brains are with it today uh show fans feel okay with this so far so we go cool uh can we separate variables of course we can let's do it can we integrate of course we can let's do it to both sides with respect to the same exact variable on this side DTS are gone we got integral of 1 y d y tell me everybody what's the integral of 1 over y d you guys are on today I like it it's Wednesday it's wedes this only good day I get out of you awesome okay how about uh how about the integral of K DT uh you need to know that whenever we have listen please whenever we have a variable here that is not this variable this is treated like a constant I don't care what it is now K is a constant variation so this is cool for us what's that going to be k Okay cool so just like if we had three we'd pull the three up front we'd have 3T uh if we had K we can pull that k out front we have KT a Conant it is a constant yeah no notice what's happening U some of you guys were talking while I was saying this but what you wouldn't do you wouldn't do k^2 over two why not well is that a t no no this is not the variable that we are integrating with respect two it's treated as a constant is that clear for you so we don't do k^ two that doesn't make sense we're integ this is this is why ladies and gentlemen your calc this one teacher made sure that this is here they go Ah that's not such a big deal don't worry about having the D whatever it doesn't make it doesn't matter because then that would be like well what are you what are you doing is K a variable is K not a variable does it matter it matters K is not a variable K right right here is treated as a constant so we're not going to get K2 we're going to get k t as if this was a constant because we treat like a constant here you could pull this out in front it' be basically the integral of DT integral of 1 DT is multip by the K you get KT should feel okay with that idea okay come on come on ah plus c yep Plus's see1 okay now every time before when we had this this was all like LNS right if it's not all LNS on this side but it is Ln over here we can still do basically the same idea to get rid of this Ln we can take both of these sides as an exponent upon e so I I I definitely want to get rid of the Ln do you guys agree with that I want to get y by itself so that's our plan here if we want to get y by itself then we go okay well cool let's take and make each side an exponent of each we've done this before this is not a big deal so we have Ln of absolute value y as an exponent we have KT please notice something here real quick this is very important you see this this whole thing is now the exponent when you do this idea the whole side becomes your exponent above your e like that quick heading on if you're okay with with that one are you sure see okay now we're going to start working with with this e Ln absolute value what happens there that's that's great this is very nice so this is what yeah that's right absolute value y but not a problem made a mistake we're going to deal with that in a minute it doesn't really matter okay uh because we get to deal with that remember that plus or minus that's where we get to deal with it so on the right hand side we're going to start man this a little bit please remember our end goal the end goal is cool you got separation of variables do it do your integral have your plus probably a C1 cuz we know this is not going to be our ending arbitrary constant you with me call C1 or something get rid of any Ln around your y not a big deal e and then make each side an exponent upon e you got it over here cool we still have absolute value y over here well this is funky and so what I'm going to try to do is get rid of this plus C1 I'm going to try to change this into the arbitrary concept that I want want and make it as nice as possible so for us I'm going to leave this e to the KT but I'm going to multiply by e to the C1 I'm going to do that notice that if I have common bases I can add exponents therefore if I have a base with added exponents I can separate into multiplication of common bases you okay with that one well that's kind of nice now at this point let's do a little uh little razzled Dazzle this is a constant true yeah is this a constant yes let's call this a constant then so we're going to make a little side note e to the C1 is now going to be equal to C 2 our second form of our constant does that make sense so here's our first one we go no no no let's split this off because if I can split this off this is nice to get rid of this thing right so hey that's still a constant this is e to the C no problem that's still a constant let's call it just a different constant well now we have absolute value of y equals I'm going to move this to the front this will be C sub 2 time e to the K as a k e to the KT okay so P feel okay with this so far we've done it before I just want to make sure that you guys are with it now there's one more problem that we have here to face what is it that's right we need to get rid of that thing and we've learned before that if we have the absolute value equal to some sort of an expression over here that what we can do to drop our absolute value is just consider that absolute value would take a positive expression or a negative expression and make it true so for us we have positive or negative C sub 2 e to the KT and there was one more little caveat that we could do here the idea was hey this is that's that's a constant right that means this thing is a constant color different constant now this thing is a positive or C sub 2 still a constant this becomes our arbitrary constant so now we're going to let c equal plus plus or plus or minus C sub and we get y = c e to KT okay I want to show if answer you loated with that so far so let's go through maybe a 20 second recap real quick to make sure that we are all with it first thing we got is this we know this means directly proportional we means we know that this means the rate of change of whatever we're talking about in this case is population so okay we have the rate of change of our population we know that that's a differential equation which we can solve we just solve that differential equation it's right here we just solved it this would be called my general solution to this differential equation if this was not here I would be completely done does that make sense to you now we also know that initial values are going to give us a particular solution so differential equation no problem without this we're done we got a general solution this is a this is basically a family of Curves you with me now to get a specific curve to get a particular value we need an initial value that's what this thing is so General solution very good has one arbitrary constant that's an arbitrary constant that's c k is going to be based on whatever your population model is okay so that's not arbitrary C is your arbitrary constant now to get our particular solution we're going to now use our starting population or our initial value in this case so let's use it initial value if you didn't catch it our initial value is our starting population it says hey how much is your population at time equals zero or so basically when you start your experiment or when you start start your research or whatever you're talking about so it says what's going to go in place of our now we don't have X's here okay we have the variable of what T's are variable and Y so what's going to go in place of our t z good what's going to go in place of our y y sub Z that's CU I ask why not why yeah so what we do here is we go okay well this says remember that Y is a function of T we set it right here Y is a function of T so when I have y of Zer it means that well C is still there e still there K is still there but T becomes zero now it says y when I plug in zero is going to give me y Sub 0 well this this Y is then y Sub 0 quick sh answer be okay with that so far now this is going to be kind of interesting and hopefully it makes sense that we're going to get not an actual number for for C because we don't have an actual number here does that make sense to you I'll explain this in just a bit so it makes absolute perfect concrete s for sense for you what's going to happen to our e to the K * 0 how much is that going to be so this is z e to0 is one there for what we get is y Sub 0 = c y Sub 0al C does that make sense let's go one step further we're to finish this thing off so for the last time overly General differential equation not a problem if I have an initial value I can get a particular solution our particular solution therefore is y equals uh what did our C change to all the way down what's our C let's talk about what this actually means let's talk about what this means did you all understand that y Sub 0 equals sorry uh y of 0al Y Sub 0 is your starting population please listen up here for a second let's say that your starting population was I don't know 200 200 whatever 200 units people uh whatever word be talking about so at time Z you'd have 200 does that make sense yeah over here you wouldn't have y of0 equals y Sub 0 you'd have y 0al 200 your C would equal 200 here does that make sense this would be 200 y Sub 0 stands for your starting population so what's nice about doing it this way what's nice about solving this once and for all is that now we have a model for growth or Decay based on your starting population please keep in mind that y sub Z is your starting population what is that p e t it's really similar and that's very very interesting um because we get that growth of Interest uh the amount of interest that you earn what is it it's amount isn't it equals the principal e to the rate time time very interesting uh that we get get it from here but yep that's where it comes from so what this is is this is a solution for growth or Decay where y sub Z is our starting population what that means is that anytime you want to find out how your population's growing or decaying you can use this model right now we did it right we said hey if it's directly proportional to the size the rate of change equals this not a problem we solved our differential equation generally we said now let's consider that at Time Zero we have a starting population if we use the time Z equals a starting population then C actually equals that starting this is all I'm trying to say is that our constant our arbitrary constant is actually equal to the starting population that's what I'm trying to say here what that means is that this guy right here is basically a Sol solution for growth or Decay where y sub Z is a star population um talk about a couple other things I mentioned it over here but I want to give you a picture of it let's say that K is positive if K is positive understand a couple things about this y sub Z is a constant do you understand that it's going to be a number here so it's going to be whatever you're starting with it's not a variable it's going to be like uh in this classroom we start with that's a weird talk about growth I don't want to talk about Decay either I want do all the die or anything let's say that we have a a culture of bacteria okay it's going to start somewhere at a finite number that's going to go here so notice that's a constant but this is e to some variable it's an exponential based on E well if that's the case t t is always going to be what positive or negative for sure we're not going to go backwards in time so K is the only thing that's going to to determine how this graph looks if K is positive if K is positive it's got to grow because it is an e a function of e to some power do you remember how e looks it's the remember that so it's going to do this now of course for us if this is based on time what part of this graph is not valid this doesn't matter because we can't have negative time we're starting at zero so this is what it says that hopefully this makes sense to you it says you're going to start somewhere hey look at that you're G to start at zero you'd start at this starting point why that makes perfect sense that's our population size right there it says that if K is positive you will be growing at some rate exponentially yes that's how growth works if you think about it you start with two bunnies lot of bunnies Okay give it a year produces as much meat as a cow okay if you have two bunnies you just let them go do whatever bunnies do now if K is negative we get that other graph this one again for the same reason because this is a function of T and T cannot be negative that side doesn't matter well this would be what growth or Decay actually you're going to start somewhere hey look at that if you plug in zero you're still going to get y Sub Zero your popul start Somewhere Only now it's declining does that make sense to you yeah sure P feel okay with this idea cool would you like some examples of how to actually do this question the proof right this is this is yeah uh this is a proof that we can do natural growth or Decay with this model that's basically what that's saying um I'm basically saying hey you know what if I get to tell you that our population is growing or declining uh or find out what your population is is doing you can use this with your starting population now we're going to talk about some very simple examples and build on this right now any you guys a good question any other questions at all did this side make sense to you I got to erase this before I get keep going okay one thing that does have to be present is you do have to have this idea of proportional growth if the problem doesn't state that then you can't really assume it so this is all based on the idea that the population is growing or decaying at the prop in proportionality to the starting population or to the population does that make sense some things grow or Decay outside of proportion to the population um for instance I'm not sure if this is exactly true but I would think it would be true if you have a series of bacteria and you drop some acid onto it uh it's probably going to die very very quickly not proportional to itze size that's going to be outside cause it's cause it done does that make sense or an antibiotic or something so that would be nonproportional to the size it's going to kill it all in a matter of seconds whether it's five bacteria or a billion bacteria you just dump it on there and it's gone does that make sense so what we have to State on here for us to do this your problem has to be worded something like this growth of bacteria is proportional to the population it's got to say something about the proportionality of growth or Decay okie dokie growth of bacteria is proportional to uh its back to its population and the reason why it has to be is because this this right here this comes from the idea of that directly proportional uh model so we have to have that somewhere worded where it's proportional initially 600 bacteria are present after three hours 10,000 bacteria are present you ever done any work in algebra uh with direct variation or inverse variation you know that you you basically have to be given two two things you got to be given a formula which we have you got to be given a scenario like after this amount of time this is happening so in order for us to find K this would have to be the case so you'd say okay what's the starting size let's give some time and say oh now it's here now we have some sort of a model to base this growth on does that make sense to you so here's what we're going to do uh what I want to do is find the amount of bacteria after T hours find number of bacteria after T hours you see if we can do this if we can find after T hours then we can plug in however many hours we want and we'll be able to find a good model for our bacteria so far so good yeah basically what you said is right we're going to be finding K here we got to find that con that variation that constant variation for this particular model so uh man what are we going to do well uh do we have AEL model for growth or Decay that's based on proportional proportionality to a population Yeah we actually did it don't redo all this stuff okay I did this for reason so that we understand that this is that's okay so we have uh all right well this is very convenient for us uh we know that y = y Sub 0 e to the K T we know that's true we also know something right off the bat right off the bat we know one of these pieces what's what one of these pieces do we know initial and final we know initial so initial says Hey y sub Z is how much that's right that's always this is what I was trying to get at you here is that your your arbitrary constant is here CU we we showed it proved it y sub Z is your initial population which makes it really nice W the bat you go okay how much did you start with you started with 600 your initial value is at Time Zero it is the 600 units of bacteria okay show feel okay with with that one it's kind of simple but I want to make sure that you actually get it next up do we know what do you mean what's our time 3 hours and what do we have after 3 hours 10,000 10,000 what bacteria and that's a population so if Y is our population variable then y when I plug in 3 hours is equal to how much do you notice how I'm creating another type of it's not an initial value but it's another uh it's a basically an order pair it says when you have t of three you get y = 10,000 this is what this second sentence basically tells us so okay with with that one let's plug the numbers in so we had our initial 600 units of bacteria at time equals zero well that's that's not bad um that was pretty easy to actually do you think about it you could plug in uh zero and 600 and you solve for y not every single time couldn't you even if you didn't have this you could do that you say what's a when T equals z this is gone correct and Y would equal 600 hey y Sub 0 equal 600 duh that's a PC we just did it once and for all that's why it was so easy over here now when y equals sorry when = 3 after 3 hours after 3 hours we have 10,000 units of bacteria so what goes where 10,000 10,000 goes here no 10,000 goes here yes 600 is not going to change e to the K3 K * sure K * 3 so why was 10,000 no problem this is how this this this works here of order pair Works says this goes for your y this goes for your other independent variable of T your K is what we're looking for how am I going to do that divide by 600 I would do that I would divide by 600 so if I divide by what am I going to get if I divide by 600 100 6 say what now say 100 100 let's try to simplify 50 over 3 maybe 16 so 50 3 = e to the K * 3 so feel okay with that one now tell you what we're going to be smart about this hopefully we're be smart about this I'm not not going to do an Ln on both sides I'm not going to do that I know there's an e right there but I'm going to be smart about this here's what I'm going to do what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually make this so instead of getting K itself all I really need is to substitute for a part of this right just a part of it I just need not just the K but maybe if we can get rid of the whole e to the K that would be kind of nice wouldn't that be kind of nice so I'm not going to solve for K I'm going to solve for e to the K what that means means is that if I have e to the K * 3 what if I take that to a 1/3 power I do that on both sides is this 1/3 going to get rid of this three we have exponents raised to exponents we multiply yes yes this is gone so what this says is 50 over 3^ 1/3 power is equal to e to the K now that is a good substitution this is what we can put in right here now that's a problem I'm not going to do parentheses that would be mathematical error uh but this is what we're going to be doing here show p is okay with with that one so we have a solve for K we've solved for e to the k no problem just let that be our substitution does that make sense to you okay so let's do it U I'm going to change this around just a little bit so that we we see what's going on this would be y = 600 e to K * t or if you thought about it differently this would be y = 600 E to the K to the T power you guys okay with that one am I going too fast for you or are we okay it's just some algebra but I know the algebra can be intimidating for some of us okay well then y = 600 um do we have an expression that's equal to e the K how much is it let's be real careful about this that's all being raised to the T you guys with me on that one so we said all right cool um we we have this this piece K we have this this will let us solve for our K if we want it to we're smarter than you know okay I could I could solve for my K right now if I want with an Ln no big deal uh or I could think about well let's make things a little bit nicer let's just solve for e to the K and use that substitution so are you okay solving for e to the K here with that 1/3 power well now we go all right well let's think about this this is really 600 E K all to the T since e k = 50 3 1/3 power e k = 50 over 3 1/3 power but this is raised to the T therefore this is raised to the T power you follow one last thing we're going to do this is nasty exponent raised to that's nasty even the r it's written you're going to make that better I find my handwriting is getting worse and worse as I get older and that's not cool my written like on my Note it's perfect but on the board I keep going faster and faster gets sloppier and sloppy so I got to stop that make a mental note to stop that expon raise to an exponent what do you do let's let's put that together let's have y = 600 50 over3 to the what power t t over3 that's perfect 1/3 t or t over3 that's fantastic now here's my question is this going to be the growth model for everything in the world no this is only for this specific type of bacteria and we got that because we had an initial population we had to have that and we had to have how it's actually growing how it's growing lets us make this model for it so far so good but now that we have this I can ask you any question that I want to uh for in can I ask you how much bacteria will be present after 5 hours yes sure let's figure that out how much bacteria will be present after 5 hours how much bacteria present after five hours where would the five go here there's only two two places to plug numbers in in it uh the T stands for your time what's the Y stand foration that's very good your population no matter what s for your population so population size and your time so if I want after 5 hours our population would equal a starting population of 600 * 50 over 3 to the 5 5/3 so we do 50 divid 3 take to the 5/3 power then multiply by 600 by order operations make sure you do it in that order and Y would equal what so fast 65247 same same yeah I have no idea wait what you say it was 65 2478 this is called 6.5 * 10 65248 about I'm in degrees about 64 65248 65248 what BAC little bitty bacteria that's right now I'm no scientist I'm really not I'm not very good at science actually I was a decent science uh but let's just pretend for a second that it takes uh 20,000 bacteria to make you sick or so you present symptoms so you get this little infection of 600 bacteria and after five hours you get 65,000 bacteria are you going to start feeling symptoms if the symptoms start uh yeah at 40 yeah okay I don't know if that's the way it works but I'm going to pretend it does in my little mind that makes sense to me uh but anyway no matter what we can find out a growth model for this particular bacteria does that make sense until the food runs out once food runs out well then naturally it's going to start decaying okay last question could you find out how long it would take to grow bacteria to a certain size yeah let's find that one out so what do I want when will the bacteria when will the the the uh bacteria reach a population size of 24,000 maybe this is the better question it says okay tell you what we know with this strain of bacteria that you start feeling symptomatic at when the bacteria is over 24,000 units or whatever uh we started 600 units so right now we need to figure out well when's it going to reach that how long does it take for you to start feeling or whatever whatever we're talking about how long does it take for it to reach that population no matter what we're talking about where would the 24,000 go why so we'd say from our model here this is what we can use in either situation only ask two questions how much is it going to be after a certain time or when's this time it's going to be a certain amount so 24,000 equals 600 I give you nice numbers 50 over 3 to the T over three my goodness how in the world would you solve that yeah I divide by 600 to start with so we'd get how much 40 40 40 yeah 40 well there's really no way around it here what are we going to do natural now it's natural log of both sides because we got to get to this exponent so natural log of 40 equals natural log of bunch of crap why we do this I'm not going to teach you to algebra again why we do this is so that we can bring the exponent down if we do that Ln of 40 equal T over3 Ln 503 after that can you solve for your T this would be multiplying by 3 and dividing by Ln of 50 over 3 so 3 Ln 40 ided Ln of 50 over 3 equals T now I've done the work for you already so if you want to practice with your calcor go ahead and do that right now um but for us we're going to get is approximately 3.93 hours Let's see if that jives with our initial Val conditions over here okay um if it says 600 present after 3 hours we get 10,000 does it make sense that after 3.9 hours we get more than that yeah it's exponential growth so it's going to go grow faster than linear so it's it is it is growing like this okay the more bacteria you have the faster it's growing that should make sense bacteria double pretty quickly okay so you get more bacteria it's going to grow faster in proportion to its size you feel all right with that one tell you what we'll start one more now that we have this idea kind of down uh this is it goes so nice and quick for us um let's talk about something a little different than growth let's talk about Decay are there any questions on this at all did I explain it well enough for you to understand it that one question question cuz when we were solving for K you solved for EK instead so that's fine yeah Sol for EK yeah I would definitely solve for e to the K because we're just taking that little bit and substituting in there okay you could actually solve for K but then when you when you realize it it's going to be e to the Ln isn't it yeah e to the Ln is gone so we're going to be smart about this and not have to do that here there's no way around it you got to solve for T itself because we're want to find out the number of years okay have we have we uh explain this well enough for you okay one thing I think I introduced the section with this one thing that decay in proportion to its population are certain substances so let's assume that the half life of the substance is proportional to its sorry that the way that this decays is proportional to its size so suppose that the halflife of some substance of compound a is 1,62 years let's suppose that we have 100 mgram to start almost sounds like science doesn't it I'm like this chemistry all over again well is this organic chemistry or something no just regular chemistry for B 4 B I don't even know what that means let's find the amount you're going to notice that what we do for Decay what we do here is very akin to what we did for growth we're going to follow the same exact model we're going to find amount after T years well that should be pretty easy to do uh let's start find the amount after T years um do we know that this is growth or Decay yeah it's Decay uh well the model is going to be exactly the same so we're going to have y = y Sub 0 e to K * T now there's a couple things that we need to know about this couple things that we need to know about this firstly do we know how much y of Z is 100 m remember y of zero says how much do you start with do you know how much you started with you guys okay with that one you start with 100 hey y of Z or Y sub Z is going to be 100 we know that one but there's also something else you just need to know how to write it when it says a half life when it says a half life it gives us a piece of information here so it says after how many years 1602 after 16002 years we're going to have half but listen carefully we're going to have half of whatever we started with does that make sense so we're going to use our starting amount to come up with this thing if we start with 100 mg at year zero I say let's give it 16002 years we're going to have that's what half life means means you have half of it left how much is going to be left if you get this you're going to get the rest of this show hands if you get that one tell you what why don't you try this one I'm going to go through this quickly next time very quickly next time why don't you try this at home or if you're if you're watching this try this on your own find out a couple things firstly I want you to find out how much is after for two years so come go up and do this basically you can get down to this this far okay after that find out how much you'd have after 1,000 years and how long it would take to get 40 Mig so basically it I mean you can do you see the similarity here it's exactly the same I'm not asking you to go out and solve how to get to the moon or something I it's already been done a long time ago uh unless you're conspiracy theorist and they never made it whatever so after a amount of years hey after a certain amount of years this going to be very similar to this just plug the number in how much will we get to how long will it take to 40 Mig so after a thousand years how much we going to have and how long will will take to get to 40 milligrams can you guys do that for me let's do that we thousand years how long will take you 40 milligrams okay let's go uh so we have this problem we're working on as I've asked you to go do this on your own uh most of you didn't actually do that probably people on tape didn't do that either so we're going to do it together but very fast so the half life of Subs substance is 16002 years if you have 100 Mig to start with a couple questions firstly find the amount after T years now what we're going to assume is that this fits our model of y equal y0 e to KT if you'll remember from last time we got this from solving a Bas basically just solving a differential equation uh that was it this was a proportional a proportional problem that we said okay if we find a derivative that's a rate at which this is changing therefore we solve a differential equation and we have one situation that let us go from an arbitrary constant into this y sub Z it was that we are always going to start with some initial amount when we're checking population growth or Decay here our population is kind of like this 100 milligrams of some substance that we have so with our halflife the first idea is well you got to see what our y Sub 0 is and then we're going to have to see something that lets us solve for our k so firstly tell me what the Y sub Z stands for initial initial population sure initial population or initial amount that we have what is our initial amount that we have okay so what we know that right now is that y sub Z because we are in terms of t t stands for in this case it stands for years it can be any amount of time minutes hours whatever seconds sometimes for certain Half Lives um but here we have well y Sub 0 equal 100 well yes it is 100 y sub Z stands for the amount that we're going to have after zero years have passed so basically right when we started we have 100 milligram of some substance now what's interesting this is I think where I probably left you last time I'm not really sure we also have another statement given up here if we know that the half life is a certain number of years then what we know is that after that amount of years specifically here after 16002 years we're going to have half of whatever we started with what that does that gives us another ordered pair it says after this amount of time you should be able to tell me how much we have left how much are we gonna have left 50 how'd you get 50 half of yeah it's half of 100 if the half life is 1600 years then after 16002 years we're going to have half of our initial amount or half of the 100 that's the 50 should F be okay with that so far well now we start breaking it down okay so if y of Zer is 100 that means that our starting amount is simply 100 therefore instead of yal Y sub Z we go no no no our starting amount is 100 mg not a problem now what are we going to do sit here quietly very good that's exactly right what are we going to do change which is 100 1 what's the idea in plugging those numbers in what are we trying to find right now we can for K but yeah we can solve for K but a nice thing about this is that if we solve for e to the K well then we can make a larger substitution and not have to worry about the Ln so what we're going to do is we're going to try to find a value for e to the K how we do that we use this other piece of information we have to have two pieces we got to have an initial value then we have to have how much you have left after a certain amount of time you got to have another ordered pair something that tells you something additionally so in our case we go all right no not a problem uh how much how much is the Y if I plug in this is it the 1602 or is it the 50 50 yeah it says the Y is the 50 that's how much we'll have left the 100 doesn't change the E doesn't change the K is what we're we're really missing here times what's the T in our case 16 that's right what's the next thing you do try to isolate e to the K sure how are we going to isolate e to the K come on help me if we divide by that 100 we're going to get 12 equals e to the K * 162 keep wrting 1620 1602 how about after that can we solve for e to the K in this case of course we can yeah if we consider this as 12 = e to the K to the 162 power well then basically all we got to do is raise both sides to a specific value that's going to give us uh a simplification of that exponent specifically if we take both sides to the one over 16002 power it's a weird power but if we do that on both sides then what we end up getting is that e to the K = 12 to the 1/ 16 00 second power this right here do you remember that when you have xon to raised to expon we multiply 1600 * 1 over 1600 gone we just get to you the K this side we have 12 to the 1 over 1600 second power show hands feel okay with that so far I know we went through a little fast but we've done this before so I want to make sure that we get on another concept here in just a bit oh don't want to RIS that almost it well now we can do our substitution so when we do notice that we want to change this thing but we only want to change the E the K so we'll have yal 100 how much does the e to the K become is that it where's the T go okay so really this is normally like like this correct this would be oh look at this 100 e to the k no no no not e to the K we're going to have 12 the 1 over 16002 power to the T or times the T so we could have to the T power but to make it a little nicer we just have to multiply this power time T to make it a little nicer than that well instead of having one over 1,62 * T let's just put the T on the numerator that make it a little bit nicer so we have that I want to show hands you feel okay with that that one so far now this is basically all we have to do to satisfy this question find the amount after T years we've done it y stands for the amount of the substance we have left when it's based on however many years were given does that make sense this half is not coincidental if you're talking about halflife well think about that if you're talking about halflife whatever you have here is should be exactly half of whatever you have here correct and your very first step's going to be to divide you're always going to get 1 half right there it's basically just based on whatever the number of years is what where you start with whatever the number of years is show pant should be okay with with that idea now let's solve our questions if I want to find the amount after 1,000 years use our model where's the 1,000 go andt so we're going to have y equals 100 doesn't change 1/2 doesn't change we're going to have 1,00 over 16 002 and someone who's really quick with a calculator 64 64 what8 88 sure 64.8 that sounds about right let's see if that sounds about right uh what we know is this we know that half of this material should be gone after 16002 years correct yes so if I give you 1,000 years less than 1602 we should have less than half of it go is it does that work out for us we start with 100 if we if we do this and we get something like 300 your product has miraculously grown that probably won't make sense okay this is supposed to decompose over time so this is less than Halfway Gone we've had less than half the halflife so sounds about right how long will it take to get 40 milligrams what would we do in that case y yeah in this case we say all right we'll use our model here if y stands for the amount of the substance left then we're going to have 40 milligram equals well the same model 100 12 to the T over 16002 how would you solve this what would you do divide by 100 you divide by 100 so if we divide by 100 we get 410 we get two fths now at this point yeah we should probably take the natural log if we do that what's what we're going to be allowed to do is take the exponent and we're going to move that forward so natural log of 2s equal natural log of 12 to the T over 16002 after that well we should know this the reason why we do a natural log with exponentials is this allows us to Mo our exponents to the front as a coefficient so we have Ln of 2s = t/ 16002 * Ln 12 then we just do some multiplication and division if we want to solve for T we're going to multiply by 1602 we're going to divide by Ln of 12 so we get 16002 time Ln of 25ths over Ln of 12 = t as it figured that one out 2,118 years 2 let me see if that's what I got too yeah that's exactly what I got 2,18 years let's see if that fits our model half of it should be gone in600 years correct we're asking when's more than half of it going to be gone well it should be more than 1600 years we got that it's not like hugely more like a million years or something but uh few hundred years later exactly right show hands feel okay with this idea pretty straightforward actually most I mean we didn't even do calculus today did we it's basically just pluging numbers in and solving for them that's really just the idea um any questions or comments before we get on to our last one you sure okay last one this is an interesting one I like this question this idea because I've always wanted about it when I was a kid uh why why why this works the way that it works what I'm talking about is the law of cooling by the way any questions the law of what late now the law of cooling cool cooling the law of cooling are we going to apply calculus any of this this is calculus we've already done it yeah I just more no um no not really uh I just want to show you a few applications of what this can be used for um I think I've basically covered how to do differential equations by separation variables right it's a very straightforward idea we're not going to sit there and do tons of examples of that I wanted to give you something more concrete uh so I'm trying to give you some I find these interesting I really do that that this is applicable yeah we're not doing a whole lot of integrals right here but we've already done the basic integral to solve for population growth or Decay so we're just using that right now uh one way that we can use that is with this law of cooling um now what happens what happens if your house is 50° versus when your house is 90° you take something out of the oven in which case is that thing in the oven going to retain its temperature longer obviously because the the surrounding ambient temperature is warmer right well there's there's actually a law for that that's called The Law of cooling now I didn't understand that when I was a kid and I didn't understand why sometimes when you take cookies out of the oven and it's 85 they burn burn your mouth for like 30 minutes versus in the winter time you can eat him in 5 minutes I didn't get that so I always when I saw like oh yeah that might that makes perfect sense now cuz I'm an idiot when I'm a little kid bur my mouth all the time cuz I was fat kid and I couldn't wait for them to get out of I get them all anyway so mookies I still am a kind of a fat kid I I still love eating cookies who doesn't love eating cookies idiots idiots don't love eating cookies I don't know maybe some people like cookies crazy people here's what you need to know about the law of cooling a body cool and I don't mean like a dead body because that's really gross I mean a body like a an item object object sure body a body cool well you know in physics they use body body at rest tend to stay at rest body motion tends to stay at motion a body cools proportionally to the difference between the body and the ambient temperature a body cools proportionally to the difference that's interesting between the body and the ambient temperature um just I don't I know that you guys are smart but you guys know what ambient means not an ambient okay nothing with drugs uh but an ambient do you know what ambient means yes okay if you don't know what that means it means the surrounding atmosphere of of the body in this case so right now the ambient Ambient temperature would be the temperature of this room that you're in I'd say 71° I would estimate but that's the ambient temperature I'm very comfortable are you guys comfortable yeah yeah ambient temperature is nice then we're going to do this with an example so here's my example I'm such a dork that on Thanksgiving I literally did this I literally did the math on this thing to find out uh how this would actually work cuz I'm I'm so work um although I I kind of overcooked my turkey so it was really dry because I cooked it to 225 degrees internal temperature and you don't have to do that it's like 165 or something like that that's what gravy is for that's what gravy is for that's right I don't like turkey I I ate the ham so let those other fools eat the turkey they had some burned old turkey so a turkey is taken out of an oven at 225° maybe the outside would be hotter than that even it's taken out of an oven at 200 25° after 20 minutes I checked it after 20 minutes it was 185° that was a well done ter now you need to know that at my house it stays a nice 70° all the time is that important to know yes yes because if I was really cheap during Thanksgiving and said I'm not run the heater at all it'd be like 50° in which case the turkey would cool off faster much more convenient for eating but you have to eat in a jacket so that's not super fun if I kept it at 90° my electricity be able be through the roof but the turkey would not cool off for a long time so it'd be very comfortable in shorts but not be able to eat for a few hours so anyway uh my temperature in the house or the the ambient temperature the temperature of the house was 70° at the time here's what we want to do I want to find the temperature at any time then I'm going to ask you a series of questions how much is the temperature after 30 minutes uh when can I cut the turkey and not burn my fingers so we'll ask a couple of those things so um firstly we need to understand that y of t let Define our variables right here y of T is going to be what what does the y stand for in our case here the y y the Y is going to be my temperature that's right so y of t y of T says this give me the temperature I know we're not using a t for temperature but y stands for temperature here give me the temperature after a given amount of time so this would be the um temperature let's also Define what T is over here T was in years uh is my time in years here it's going to take me 30 years to eat my turkey no that's silly okay it's going to be it's in minutes so time in minutes time and minutes now there's a few things that we need to identify before we start our problem the first one is this first one we got to figure out what our initial values are for the situation so can you tell me now that we have this can you tell me how much y of Z is in fact can you tell me what y of0 actually means in reference to this problem it's kind of good to know right I don't want you just to do these things by rot memorization of how to do differen equations in these cooling problems but understand what the what it means what does y of Z actually mean when you first took it out of the oven good so this going to be the temperature when I first took it out not when I start cooking it but right when I open the oven door because it's going to start cooling at that moment when I take it right out of the oven so at y of z mean or sorry y of zero means the temperature right when I remove it how much is that to 25 perfect do we know anything else about this problem right now after 20 after how many 20 how am I going to write that y 20 185 good so it says Hey the temperature after 20 minutes was 185 that's a two pieces of information I know we always need those two pieces of information where we're starting and how it's How that uh temperature is declining or or how the population is growing we need another piece of information to be able to solve for our e to the K or our K or whatever we're talking about in each case so far so good now the last thing we need to know is what the differential equation looks like well it's important that we actually set this up correctly you see we're not going to have exactly the same model every time we got to think about what's going on if we know that a body cools proportionally that's cool that's going to be no pun intended but that's going to be K times something for sure now if it says the body cools proportionally to the difference between well that's going to be that's be something else it's be a little different here so here's what we know that right there would be please pay attention I'm going to change this you don't need to write this down right now just sit here and watch this would be a rate of change that is proportional to something this would be proportionality we've talked about this before does that make sense if I want the rate of change being proportional to just what the temperature is I'm good that's what this says rate of change is proportional to the temperature got it temperature right here is my amount do you understand that it's it's not like a the size of the turkey that's not what I'm talking about it's the temperature itself the hotter it is the faster it's going to cool in a given situation as it gets closer and closer to the to the temperature of the room it's going to cool slow more slowly does that make sense to you it's it's proportional Decay but it's it's on that exponential model um so anyway this would be proportional growth or Decay now I'm not directly proportional to the temperature what I am directly proportional to says okay you're going to be proportional it's going to be K times something I'm directly proportional to what the difference between what body and the Ambi between the body difference means what subra and the ambient temperature what's the ambient temperatures that's where that comes into play so I want you to understand why this is the way that it is firstly do you understand that when I'm proportional it's going to be K * something that's what a proportional concept means so our rate of change is proportional that means our rate of change will be K times some amount it should tell you what it's what it's in reference to up here so if it was just hey the rate of decline of my temperature is proportional to the temperature it would have been KY now you have you understand that concept it's not though it says the rate of change of my temperature is proportional K times to the difference ah between the body the temperature of the body remember that y stands for the temperature of the body and the ambient temperature so this says it's proportional the difference sorry the the rate of change of my temperature is proportional K times to the difference between the temperature of the body and the ambient temperature show if be okay with these Concepts it's important to set up right otherwise we're going to be kind of kind of stuck on this thing now for the calculus we're going to go through it it doesn't fit the model so yeah we're going to have to do a little bit more calculus here um let's think about this in terms of a differential equation we already got our initial values that's cool cool can you do that differential equation first is it a differential equation oh yeah it's an equation it's got a first order difference equation situation going on here can you separate the variables yeah how would you do that divide by no I don't want to do that I want to get y's on the left hand side I want the K's on the right hand side not going to do that either y yeah let's just do that let's move this whole piece over here so if I move this whole piece over here I've got 1 over y - 70 Dy DX equal K hey are all my y variables on one side and everything else on the other side yes that's what I'm looking for that's a separation of variables thanks for emphasis yeah Drop It Like It's Hot throw B anyway uh what would I do at this point now that I have my variables on different sides what do I do come on you should know this what do we do some of you know it yeah you're just not excited about it goodness so we're going to integrate both sides with respect to X well not really in fact I have I have this uh completely wrong from the very beginning uh you should tell me the one mistake I've made actually I've made lots of mistakes but today I've made one mistake and no one caught it actually so I just kind of left it I wrote it like I'm have to catch that uh I made a mistake from almost the beginning what is it DT it's not with there's no X we don't have one so be careful with with I I messed up right here and I just left it I want to see if you caught it we we need to really be we failed you failed it should be a DT listen it's not a rate of change with respect to X you don't even know X is right here we have a rate of change with respect to temperature it's the way the temperature is changing okay with respect to time temperature with time temperature with time the way the temperature is changing with respect to time right there temperature with time time now let's continue DTS canc yeah that's right they do so DTS are gone got that we got integral of 1/ y - 70 Dy equals integral of K D DT can you tell me something about about this side do we do K two in this case no we're integrating with respect to which is why it was so important we had this correct you got to get your the the varibles correct on this it says K is treated like a constant here K is a constant it's constant variation so we're going to have K keep going oh okay how about the left hand side we have 1 y - 7 what are you going to do with that L are you starting to see how we're going to have lots of LNS right now lots of Ln here so Ln we do a little substitution we say hey der of this is only one though so our integral is going to be pretty easy we're going to get absolute value of y - 7 inside of that for the argument of our LM so P be okay with that one okay calculus was pretty easy calculus is done now our job is to do what with this find arbitrary uhhuh well we're going to have to solve for y to do so let's get rid of Ln how we get rid of Ln got so treat that as an exponent upon e on both sides Ln absolute value y - 70 = e to the whole thing KT + C sub one here Ln is gone we get absolute value y - 70 right hand side we get e to the KT I've done this before so I'm going quickly times e to the C1 so far so good we're going to call C2 e to C1 since this piece is a constant I'm going to call it a different constant therefore I get absolute value of y - 70 equal C2 e to KT last thing we're going to do again we're moving quickly because this is exactly what we've done before do you guys see how similar this is from what we've done before we're going to say y - 70 = plus or minus C sub 2 e KT and then we're going to find our arbitrary constant C to equal plus or minus C to the uh C sub 2 since this is going to be a constant I got y - 70 = c e the KT oop sorry I should have actually done that need more space that's General this is the general that's right this is the general solution to this differential equation we started right here that's the general solution show hands be okay with the general solution now how do we go from a general solution to a particular solution what do we do now we've already used well did we use any of them what have we used so far well nothing really 70 we just use a 70 the Aban can we solve for our c that would be our first case which one do we use to solve for our C initial ini probably this one would be easy to do right we'd plug in where would the zero Ro go I I want to make sure you guys are okay getting some kind of vague looks on your faces either you're tired or you're bored or you don't get it I want just the first two actually I don't want any of them so knock those off everybody um are you okay with getting this far on your own yeah pretty basic separation of variables do your integral solve it all the way down get rid of the stuff we've gone through several times now now start working on what the k is and what the E what the C is get rid of the C first find out what the that arbitrary constant is with your initial value that's why they call it an initial value where you start at zero so * 0 = 225 tell me how to write that if y of 0 = 225 then y - 70 changes to what 225 yep C e to the K times what ladies and gentlemen zero perfect is this going to allow us to solve for key for C really easily yes yes for sure how much is e to the K * Z one so this whole thing is one this right how much is 225 7 155 therefore c equal 155 done we got it now let's rewrite our equation so what we know now is that y - 70 so we have our general solution not a problem use your initial value to find a particular solution so we're changing from General to particular by solving for r c that's it so General's here plug in the initial value we got it0 for RT no problem that's why it works so nicely this whole thing goes away you get C itself 2254 r y because the initial value at Z is 225 this is a constant this reduces to our c not a problem now rewrite it we know that y - 70 equals well not C anymore 155 e k * T So essentially what we've done we've used our initial value to change a general solution into a particular solution based on this initial value that's what's making it particular because listen with differential equations we're now forcing this is weird but we're forcing this family of temperature curves to go through this particular point you see this is the temperature curve for my house this is it for anything I take out of the oven in my house it's going to cool like that because my house is 70° does that make sense now I'm saying I took out something at 225 figure out what happens now that changes it to oh how much is your temperature 225 that's now a particular temperature curve had I taken it out at 450° it'd be different a different whatever that was up there okay it'd be four whatever say 450 - 7 and that would now be your C so F feel okay with that one all right so cool what now whatever you want sulur whatever you want to S what do you mean sulur whatever you ask question time and minute I just asked what do we do now oh you want us to find a general time no we're missing something up here right now we got get rid of that e to the K so how do we get rid of the E this isn't going to let us do anything right now if I say hey find the temperature after 30 minutes you're going to go cool what would be 30 what would K be we don't know I don't know that's why you have to be given this second piece of information so there's initial value initial value solves for your C your general this is going to allow you to solve for your K does that make sense so now we plug that in so from here we go okay this is cool this is a particular solution right now but this next piece is going to make it so that we can solve for my variation so if y of 20 equals 185 let's continue to plug this in uh go for it what do we do 185 - 70 185 - 70 = 155 K * 20 perfect 20 is our time 85 is our temperature now we solve it uh let's solve for e to the K like we did before that way we don't have to be worried about those LNS 85 - 70 115 = 155 e to the K I'm going to write like this right now just to the 20th power e k * 20 is the same thing as e k to the 20th then what do we do divide 155 let's do that let's divide and let's simplify what do you get when you divide 115 by 155 and simplify how much you get 23 23 over 31 now let's get rid of that exponent how do we get rid of that exponent no I don't want to do Ln right now I don't want to do that I want to leave the e to the K because what I'm going to do is for this whole entire piece right there how do we get rid of the 20 the power of 20 okay so by multiplying exponents we're taking each listen the math on this by multiplying our exponents together we're taking each side to that power so in our case we're going to take this to the 1 over 20th power and this side to the 1 over 20th power so 23 over 31 to 1/ 20th power equals e k because these things are gone what that does for us it changed now our particular solution into something will work only with this only with this situation with our turkey okie dokie actually so the 225 kind of did that too but that would be for anything out taken out of the oven but if I took cookies out of the oven at 225 well they're probably not going to match this situation so this is just for this particular turkey does that make sense so General worked for anything in uh my house particular said anything in my house taken out of the oven at 225° this one says anything taken out of sorry the one we're about to make says anything taken out of the oven at 225° in in my house at look at in my house at 225° and now this last one says and fits this scenario where after 20 minutes it's 185° I need to make sure you guys get this are you okay translating from this guy to this guy using this mhm this was hey same thing same thing e to the K is now this piece to the 1 over 20 but since I'm multiplying by T I get T over 20 instead of 1 over 20 show up hands you right with that one so let's go through it one time real quick here that- 70 came because the difference between the temperature of the body and the temperature of my house so my this is for my house 70° this came from solving for a particular solution sorry particular uh yeah particular solution given that the item starting out the body starting out is 225° does that make sense to you this comes from this particular piece of information saying that this has to fit the scenario that after 20 minutes it's 185° if the body doesn't fit that scenario this won't work but I could maybe change that does that make sense to you okay so now we continue let's solve this for y just one little step how can I solve it for y just add so y = 70 + 155 23 over 31 to the T over 20 I get two questions first question what will the temperature of my turkey be after 30 minutes where would the 30 go pretty easy now it's just plugging numbers in so we' say the temperature would equal 70 + 155 23 31 to the well T stands for this is why we defined it okay T was time in minutes we had on the board earlier T was time in minutes if I want 30 minutes i' put 30 over 20 y equals y stands for our temperature that's we said Y in terms of T was our temperature we already defined that how much is that did you figured out 169 yeah about 169° that's still a really hot turkey let's see if it fits listen um after 20 minutes it was 185 it's cooling right after 30 minutes it should be cooler was it yeah hey that works now let's find out this how long does Mr Leonard have to wait to cut his turkey so he won't burn his fingers what's the how long does Mr Leonard have have to wait to cut the turkey darn turkey burnning my fingers did you really so I always burn my fingers on stupid turkey I cook them too hot how long does Mr Leonard wait are you impatient yep I'm hungry so I don't burn fingers so does so I okay go that's what I'm thinking oh dang it okay so burn my fingers so my burn I'm a hot guy so uh let's see would one I burn I can touch things that are about Aver of coffee is 140 yeah right but coffee would burn my fingers if I put in there burn all the time so I'd say let's say 125° I think I do that I think I handle 125° we need to test that it's hot 125° is hot I don't know what you just said I imagine it has to do with food uh so I got the cook the water actually in my at my old house was like 130° and that would burn me so I'm guessing 125 I have to go okay but we we'll still stick with it so the temperature that's not going to apparently burn my fingers is 125° question where would the 125° go yes so for our model here for this particular turkey we'd have 125° equal 70 + 55 15 that's what I said 20 [Laughter] 23 31 T over 20 and then we start solving this thing uh to Omit time I'm just going to give you the answer because we're we're going to go over here we're already over here so we' subtract 7 we divide by 55 we take a natural log on both sides we would move our T over 20 to the front we'd multiply 20 IDE Ln of 23 31 and what you end up getting is a time of what did I do about 69.4 time it's minutes because we Define our time to be in minutes so in just over an hour I'm going to be able to cut this turkey and serve my guest some really dry it
