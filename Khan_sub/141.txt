Transcript for: Scalar field line integral independent of path direction | Multivariable Calculus | 
In the last video, we saw that if we had some curve in the x-y plane, and we just parameterize it in a very general sense like this, we could generate another parameterization that essentially is the same curve, but goes in the opposite direction.
It starts here and it goes here, as <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, as opposed to the first parameterization, we started with <EQUATION> over here, and it went up like that.
And the question I want to answer in this video is how a line integral of a scalar field over this curve, so this is my scalar field, it's a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, how a line integral over a scalar field over this curve relates to, that's a line integral of that same scalar field over the reverse curve, over the curve going in the other direction.
So the question is, does it even matter whether we move in this direction or that direction when we're taking the line integral of a scalar field? And in the next video, we'll talk about whether it matters on a vector field.
And let's see if we can get a little intuition to our answer before we even prove our answer.
So let me draw a little diagram, here.
Actually, let me do it a little bit lower, because I think I'm going to need a little bit more real estate.
So let me draw the y-axis, that is the x-axis, let me draw the vertical axis, just like that, that is <EXPRESSION>.
Let me draw a scalar field, here.
So I'll just draw it as some surface, I'll draw part of it.
That is my scalar field, that is <EXPRESSION> right there.
For any point on the x-y plane we can associate a height that defines this surface, this scalar field.
And let me put a curve down there.
So let's say that this is the curve <EXPRESSION>, just like that.
And the way we define it first, we start over here and we move in that direction.
That was our curve <EXPRESSION>.
And we know from several videos ago that the way to visualize what this line integral means, is we're essentially trying to figure out the area of a curtain that has this curve as its base, and its ceiling is defined by this surface, by the scalar field.
So we're literally just trying to find the area of this curvy piece of paper, or wall, or whatever you want to view it.
That's what this thing is.
Now, if we take the same integral but we take it the reverse curve, instead of going in that direction, we're now going in the opposite direction.
We're not taking a curve, we're going from the top to the bottom.
But the idea is still the same.
You know, I don't know which one is <EXPRESSION>, which one is <EXPRESSION>.
I could have defined this path going from that way as <EXPRESSION>, and then the <EXPRESSION> path would have started here, and gone back up.
So it seems in either case, no matter what I'm doing, I'm going to try to figure out the area of this curved piece of paper.
So my intuition tells me that the either these are going to give me the area of this curved piece of paper, so maybe they should be = each other.
I haven't proved anything very rigorously yet, but it seems that they should be = each other, right? In this case, let's say I'm taking a, let me just make it very clear.
I'm taking a <EXPRESSION>.
a little change in distance, let me do it in a different color.
A little change in distance, and I'm multiplying it by the height, to find kind of a differential of the area.
And I'm going to add a bunch of these together to get the whole area.
Here I'm doing the same thing.
I'm taking a little <EXPRESSION>, and remember, the <EXPRESSION> is always going to be positive, the way we've parameterized it.
So here, too, we're taking a <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to multiply it by the height.
So once again, we should take the area.
And I want to actually differentiate that relative to, when you take a normal integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, we know that when we switch the boundaries of the integration, that it makes the integral negative.
That = the negative of the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
And the reason why this is the case, is if you imagine this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, that is my <EXPRESSION>.
When you do it this way, your <EXPRESSION> are always going to be positive.
When you go in that direction, your <EXPRESSION> are always going to be positive, right? Each increment, the right boundary is going to be higher than the left boundary.
So your <EXPRESSION> are positive.
In this situation, your <EXPRESSION> are negative.
The heights are always going to be the same, they're always going to be <EXPRESSION>, but here your change in <EXPRESSION> is a negative change in <EXPRESSION>, when you go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
And that's why you get a negative integral.
In either case here, our path changes, but our <EXPRESSION> are going to be positive.
And the way I've drawn this surface, it's above the x-y plane, the <EXPRESSION> is also going to be positive.
So that also kind of gives the same intuition that this should be the exact same area.
But let's prove it to ourselves.
So let's start off with our first parameterization, just like we did in the last video.
We have <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and we're dealing with this from, <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
And we know we're going to need the derivatives of these, so let write that down right now.
We can write <EQUATION>, let me write that a little bit neater, <EQUATION>.
This is nothing groundbreaking I've done so far.
But we know the integral over <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is a scalar field, not a vector field.
<EXPRESSION> = the integral from <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>, which is the same thing as <EQUATION>, the same thing as <EQUATION>.
All that under the radical, times <EXPRESSION>.
This integral is exactly that, given this parameterization.
Now let's do the <EXPRESSION> version.
I'll do that in this orange color.
Actually, let me do the <EXPRESSION> version down here.
The minus the <EXPRESSION> version, we have <EXPRESSION> =, you remember this, actually, just from up here, this was from the last video.
<EQUATION>.
<EQUATION>.
And then <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, and this is just exactly what we did in that last video.
<EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, same curve, just going in a different direction as <EXPRESSION> increases <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
But let's get the derivative.
I'll do it in the derivative color, maybe.
So <EXPRESSION>.
For this path, it's going to be a little different.
We have to do the chain rule now.
Derivative of the inside with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
Well, these are constants.
Derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
So it's <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of the outside with respect to the inside.
Well, that's just <EXPRESSION>.
Or, we could rewrite this as, this is just <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, same logic.
Derivative of the inside is <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, right? Derivative <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.
Times the derivative of the outside with respect to the inside.
So <EXPRESSION>, same thing as <EXPRESSION>.
So given all of that, what is this integral going to be =, the integral of <EXPRESSION> of the scalar field <EXPRESSION>? What is this going to be =? Well, it's going to be the integral from, you could almost pattern match it.
<EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.
But now <EXPRESSION> is no longer <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> now = <EXPRESSION>.
It's a little bit hairy, but I don't think anything here is groundbreaking.
Hopefully it's not too confusing.
And once again, <EXPRESSION> is no longer <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
And then <EXPRESSION>, I'll just switch colors, <EXPRESSION>.
What is <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is just this thing squared, or this thing squared.
This thing, if I have minus anything squared, that's the same thing as anything squared, right? This = <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing is just <EXPRESSION>, right? You lose that minus information when you square it.
So that's going to be = <EXPRESSION>.
By the same logic, that's going to be, you lose the negative when you square it.
<EXPRESSION>.
Let me extend the radical.
And then all of that <EXPRESSION>.
So that's the line integral over the curve <EXPRESSION>, this is the line integral over the curve <EXPRESSION>.
They don't look = just yet.
This looks a lot more convoluted than that one does.
So let's see if we can simplify it little bit.
And we can simplify it, perhaps, by making a substitution.
Let's let, let me get a nice substitution color, let's let <EQUATION>.
So first we're going to have to figure out the boundaries of our integral, well actually, let's just figure out, what's <EXPRESSION>? so <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just going to be = <EXPRESSION>, or we could say that <EXPRESSION>, if we multiply both sides by the differential <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.
And let's figure out our boundaries of integration.
When <EQUATION>, what is <EXPRESSION> =? <EQUATION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.
And then when <EQUATION>, u<EQUATION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.
So if we do the substitution on this crazy, hairy-looking interval, let's simplify a little bit, and it changes our so this integral is going to be the same thing as the integral from <EXPRESSION>, when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
And <EQUATION>, this thing right here is just .<EXPRESSION>
<EXPRESSION>.
So it simplified it a good bit.
And y of, this thing right here, is just <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
Times the square root let me do it in the same color.
Times the square root of <EXPRESSION>.
Instead of a <EXPRESSION>, we have to write a, or could write, if we multiply both sides of this by minus, we have <EXPRESSION>.
So instead of a <EXPRESSION>, we have to put a <EXPRESSION> here.
So this is times <EXPRESSION>, or, just so we don't think this is a subtraction, let's just put that negative sign out here in the front, just like that.
So we're going from <EXPRESSION> of this thing, right, like that.
And just to make the boundaries of integration make a little bit more sense, because we know that <EXPRESSION> is less than <EXPRESSION>, let's swap them.
And I said at the beginning of this video, for just a standard, regular, run of the mill integral, if you swap, if you have something going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, maybe I should write it this way.
<EXPRESSION>.
This = the minus of the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
And we did that by the logic that I had graphed up here.
That here, when you switch the order, your du's will become the negatives of each other, when you actually visualize it, when you're actually finding the area under the curve.
So let's do that.
Let's swap the boundaries of integration right here.
And if we do that, that will negate this negative, or make it a positive.
So this is going to be = the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
I'm dropping the negative sign, because I swapped these two things.
So I'm going to take the negative of a negative, which is a positive.
Of <EXPRESSION>.
Now remember, everything we just did was a substitution.
This was all =, just to remember what we're doing, this was the integral of the minus curve of our scalar field, <EXPRESSION>.
Now how does this compare to when we take the regular curve? How does this compare to that? Let me copy and paste it to see.
You know, I'm using the wrong tool.
Let me copy and paste it to see how they compare.
Copy, then let me pick to down here, edit, paste.
So how do these two things compare? Let's take a close look.
Well, they actually look pretty similar, right? Over here, for the minus curve, we have a bunch of <EXPRESSION>.
Over here, for the positive curve, we have a bunch of t's, but they're in the exact same places.
These integrals are the exact same integrals.
If you make a u-substitution here, if you just make the substitution <EQUATION>, this thing is going to be integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of, it's going to be the exact same thing.
Of <EXPRESSION>.
These two things are identical.
So we did all the substitution, everything, but we got the exact same integrals.
So hopefully that satisfies you that it doesn't matter what direction we go on the curve, as long as the shape of the curve is the same.
Doesn't matter if we go forward or backward on the curve, we're going to get the same answer.
And I think that meets our intuition, because in either case, we're finding the area of this curtain.
