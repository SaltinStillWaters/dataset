Transcript for: Line integral example 1 | Line integrals and Green's theorem | Multivariable Calculus | 
The last video was very abstract in general, and I used you know, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.
What I want to do in this video is do an actual example.
Let's say I have <EXPRESSION>.
Let's say that <EQUATION>.
And let's say that we have a path in the <EXPRESSION> plane, or a curve in the <EXPRESSION> plane.
And I'm going to define my curve by <EXPRESSION> being = <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> being = <EXPRESSION>.
And we're going to go from you know, we have to define what are our boundaries in our <EXPRESSION> and we're going to go from <EQUATION> or <EXPRESSION> is going to be greater than or = <EXPRESSION> and then less than or =.
We're going to deal in radians, <EXPRESSION>.
If this was degrees, that would be <EXPRESSION> degrees.
So that's our curve.
And immediately you might already know what this type of a curve looks like.
And I'm going to draw that really fast right here in and we'll try to visualize this.
I've actually drafted ahead of time so that we can visualize this.
So this curve right here, if I were to just draw it in the standard <EXPRESSION> plane do that in a different color so we can make the curve green; let's say that is <EXPRESSION>, and this is right here <EXPRESSION> so when <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, so <EQUATION>.
We're going to be at <EQUATION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>, so we're going to be right there.
That's what <EXPRESSION> =; <EQUATION>.
When <EQUATION>, what's going to happen? <EXPRESSION> that's the angle; <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
We're going to be at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
So this is when we're at <EQUATION>.
You might recognize what we're going to draw is actually the first quadrant of the unit circle; when <EQUATION>, or <EXPRESSION> degrees, we're going to be at <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
You can try it out for yourself, but we're just going to have a curve that looks like this.
It's going to be the top right of a circle, of the units circle.
It's going to have radius <EXPRESSION>.
And we're going to go in that direction, from <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>.
That's what this curve looks like.
But our goal isn't here just to graph a parametric equation.
What we want to do is raise a fence out of this kind of base and rise it to this surface.
So let's see if we can do that or at least visualize it first, and then we'll use the tools we used in the last video.
So right here I've graphed this function, and I've rotated it a little bit so you can see [UNINTELLIGIBLE] case.
This right here let me get some dark colors out that right there is the <EXPRESSION> axis, that in the back is the <EXPRESSION> axis, and the vertical axis is the <EXPRESSION> axis.
And this is actually <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION> right here, <EQUATION> is right there, so this is graphed that way.
So if I were to graphs this contour in the <EXPRESSION> plane, it would be under this graph and it would go like something like this- let me see if I can draw it it would look something like this.
This would be on the <EXPRESSION> plane.
This is the same exact graph, <EQUATION>.
This is <EXPRESSION>; <EQUATION>.
That's both of these, I just rotated it.
In this situation that right there is now the <EXPRESSION> axis.
I rotated to the left, you can kind of imagine.
That right there is the <EXPRESSION> axis, that right there is the <EXPRESSION> axis it was rotated closer to me that's the <EXPRESSION> axis.
And then this curve, if I were to draw in this rotation, is going to look like this: when <EQUATION>, we're at <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and it's going to form a unit circle, or half or quarter of a unit circle like that.
And when <EQUATION>, we're going to get there.
And what we want to do is find the area of the curtain that's defined.
So let's see, let's raise a curtain from this curve up to <EXPRESSION>.
So if we keep raising walls from this up to <EXPRESSION>, we're going to have a wall looks something like that.
Let me shade it in, color it in so it looks a little bit more substantive.
So a wall that looks something like that.
If I were to try to do it here this would be under the ceiling, but the wall look something like that right there.
We want to find the area of that.
We want to find the area of this right here where the base is defined by this curves, and then the ceiling is defined by this surface here, <EXPRESSION>, which I graphed and I rotated in two situations.
Now in the last video we came up with <EXPRESSION>, well, you could argue whether it's simple, but the is, well, let's just take small arc lengths change in arc lengths, and multiply them by the height at that point.
And those small change in arc lengths, we called them <EXPRESSION>, and then the height is just <EXPRESSION> at that point.
And we'll take an infinite sum of these, from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION> will = <EXPRESSION>, and then that should give us the area of this wall.
So we said is, well, to figure out the area of that we're just going to take the integral from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION> it doesn't make a lot of sense when I write it like this of <EXPRESSION> times or let me even better, instead of writing <EXPRESSION>, let me just write the actual function.
Let's get a little bit more concrete.
So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> times so the particular <EXPRESSION> times the little change in our arc length at that point.
I'm going to be very hand-wavy here.
This is all a little bit review of the last video.
And we figured out in the last video this change in arc length right here, <EXPRESSION>, we figured out that we could rewrite that as the square root of the <EXPRESSION> versus or the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then all of that times <EXPRESSION>.
So I'm just rebuilding the formula that we got in the last video.
So this expression can be rewritten as the integral from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.
But you know what? Right from the get go we want everything eventually be in terms of <EXPRESSION>.
So instead of writing <EXPRESSION>, let's substitute the parametric form.
So instead of <EXPRESSION> let's write <EXPRESSION>.
That is <EXPRESSION>.
<EQUATION> on this curve.
That's how we define <EXPRESSION>, in terms of the parameter <EXPRESSION>.
And then times <EXPRESSION>, which we're saying is <EXPRESSION>.
That's our <EXPRESSION>; all I did is rewrote <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is this; it's the square root of the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
All of that times <EXPRESSION>.
And now we just have to find these two derivatives.
And it might seem really hard, but it's very easy for us to find the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> and the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
I can do it right or down here.
Let me lose our graphs for a little bit.
We know that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just going to be: what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, it's <EXPRESSION>.
And the derivative of <EXPRESSION> was respect to <EXPRESSION>? Derivative of a sine of anything is the cosine of that anything.
So it's <EXPRESSION>.
And we can substitute these back into this equation.
So remember, we're just trying to find the area of this curtain that has our curve here as kind of its base, and has this function, this surface as it's ceiling.
So we go back down here, and let me rewrite this whole thing.
So this becomes the integral from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION> I don't like this color of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> that's just the <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>, which is this expression right here.
And now we can write this as I'll go switch back to that color I don't like the derivative of x with respect to t is minus sine of t, and we're going to square it, plus the derivative of y with respect to t, that's <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to square it let me make my radical a little bit bigger and then all of that times <EXPRESSION>.
Now this still might seem like a really hard integral until you realize that this right here, and when you take a negative number and you squared it, this is the same thing.
Let me rewrite, do this in the side right here.
<EXPRESSION>, this is equivalent to <EXPRESSION>.
You lose the sign information when you square something; it just becomes a positive.
So these two things are equivalent.
And this is the most basic trig identity.
This comes straight out of the unit circle definition: <EQUATION>.
So all this stuff under the radical sign is just = <EXPRESSION>.
And we're taking the square root of <EXPRESSION> which is just <EXPRESSION>.
So all of this stuff right here will just become <EXPRESSION>.
And so this whole crazy integral simplifies a good bit and just = the square root of <EQUATION> to <EQUATION> of and I'm going to switch these around just because it will make it a little easier in the next step of <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.
All I did, this whole thing = <EXPRESSION>, got rid of it, and I just switched the order of that.
It'll make the next up a little bit easier to explain.
Now this integral You say <EXPRESSION>, what's the antiderivative of that? And the first thing you should recognize is, hey, I have a function or an expression here, and I have its derivative.
The derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
So you might be able to a <EXPRESSION> substitution in your head; it's a good skill to be able to do in your head.
But I'll do it very explicitly here.
So if you have something that's derivative, you define that something as <EXPRESSION>.
So you say <EQUATION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EQUATION>.
Or if you multiply both sides by the differential <EXPRESSION>, if we're not going to be too rigorous, you get <EQUATION>.
And notice right here I have a <EXPRESSION>.
And then <EXPRESSION>, this thing right here, that thing = <EXPRESSION>.
And then we just have to redefine the boundaries.
When <EQUATION> I mean so this thing is going to turn into the integral instead of <EQUATION>, when <EQUATION> what is <EXPRESSION> =? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so this goes from <EQUATION>.
When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
So when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
So from = <EXPRESSION> to <EQUATION>.
Just redid the boundaries in terms of <EXPRESSION>.
And then we have instead of sign of <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>.
And instead of <EXPRESSION>, I'm just going to write <EXPRESSION>.
And then this is a super-easy integral in terms of <EXPRESSION>.
This is just =: the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> we just raised the exponent and then divided by that raised exponent so <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to evaluate it from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
And so this is going to be = <EXPRESSION>, which = <EXPRESSION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.
So we did all that work and we got a nice simple answer.
The area of this a curtain we just performed a line integral the area of this curtain along this curve right here is let me do it in a darker color on <EXPRESSION>.
You know, if this was in centimeters, it would be <EXPRESSION>.
So I think that was you know, a pretty neat application of the line integral.
