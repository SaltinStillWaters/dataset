Transcript for: Partial derivatives 2 | Multivariable Calculus | 
Before we move on to other functions, let's also take the partial derivative of our function here, <EXPRESSION>, or the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
So let's do it in magenta.
So the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
Well, now we're saying how much does <EXPRESSION> change with respect <EXPRESSION> if <EXPRESSION> is constant.
So this <EXPRESSION> we treat as a constant now.
So the derivative of a constant with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so ignore it.
Now this <EXPRESSION> term.
The way we're doing it now is, <EXPRESSION> is a variable, <EXPRESSION> is a constant.
So what is the derivative of, I don't know, <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's <EXPRESSION>.
So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.
And what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's just <EXPRESSION>.
So you can see it's quite symmetric.
The partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
That's because this equation is pretty symmetric.
The <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> kind of do the same thing.
Now, we picked the point <EQUATION>.
<EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
Actually let me erase this, because I picked a different point where I graph, and I graphed it ahead of time just to save time.
So I don't think I have to include this anymore.
So what I did, I picked the point <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
And when <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>, what is z =? Let's see, 0.
<EXPRESSION> squared is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
So it's <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>, right? Just substitute <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> in for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.
<EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
So what is the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> at that point? Or we could write, <EXPRESSION>.
<EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
It =, we figured that, let's see <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, that's = <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
So the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction at that point is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
And if we take the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> at that same point, <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, that's also = <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
Let's see if we can visualize this.
Let me bring in my graph.
There we go.
So this is, this surface once again is the surface of <EQUATION>.
And this box is kind of the domain, and the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> dimensions that I define.
Kind of, I bounded it because it starts to increase really fast, and you wouldn't be able to see all this interesting stuff that happens closer in.
But this, what I did, so this vertical line, I just wanted to show you that when <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
So that just kind of helps show you that, ok, that shows what point we're working with.
And then these two lines, this is, if you think about it, this is the line where <EXPRESSION> is constant, right? So this is the slope in the <EXPRESSION>, or as the surface changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> at this point, right? This is the tangent line relative to <EXPRESSION>.
So you could kind of view it as, if you hold y constant, here's a tangent line at that point.
And if you hold <EXPRESSION> constant, here's a tangent line at that point.
And like I said in the last video, you can actually have infinite tangent lines.
You have to pick the direction that you want to go in the xy plane, and then you could plot a tangent line.
And so that's why we did partial derivatives to begin with.
Actually, this is pretty cool.
We can actually take, we can actually zoom in on this.
Zoom it a little bit more.
I want to zoom in on the part that is interesting, let me translate this.
So that's the part that's interesting.
And now let me rotate it.
So you can actually rotate.
So this is the tangent.
This shows that the partial of the function with respect to <EXPRESSION>, the slope is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
And this line shows that the partial of the slope, or the partial the function, sorry the partial of <EXPRESSION>, or the partial of the function with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, at this point.
At the point <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
And we can rotate it just to get more intuition.
I think it's, the graphing thing looks a little bit funny sometimes.
But you see that both of those lines are tangent at that point.
And in fact, two lines define a plane, and the plane that's defined by those two lines, or any of the two tangent lines to that point, defines a tangent plane to the surface.
So a does have only one tangent plane, but within a tangent plane, there are an infinite number of tangent lines.
Well anyway, that's the fun with graphing.
Now let's just chug through a bunch of partial derivative problems just so that you get used to the mathematics of it.
Delete that.
Let's do some that might confuse you, so you see how to do them.
Let's say that <EXPRESSION>, and I'm confining it to three dimensions.
Although we can do it more.
Actually, maybe I'll do it more dimensions now that we're not going to try to visualize it.
Let's say it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
So let's take the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
This is still going to be a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.
So we treat <EXPRESSION> like a constant So cosine of a constant, this is just going to be a constant.
So we can almost ignore that.
We could put that out front.
We could say that it's going to be cosine of <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
So you could say, <EXPRESSION>, it's just a number.
This <EXPRESSION> could just be, I don't know, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, or whatever.
<EXPRESSION>.
And then, because when you take the derivative the constant just comes out of the derivative.
And then we would take the derivative of the x's.
So the derivative of the first term with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well that's just <EXPRESSION>.
Times the second expression.
So <EXPRESSION>, I'm just doing the product rule here.
Plus the derivative of the second expression, that's <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of the second expression, times the first expression, times <EXPRESSION>.
So If we wanted to expand it all out, the partial of f with respect to <EXPRESSION>, this is the function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.
It = <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, plus, let's put this <EXPRESSION> out front, just so we change the order.
<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
Not too difficult.
You just have to realize that anything with the <EXPRESSION> is a constant.
So let's reverse it.
Well, not reverse it.
Let's take the partial now in the <EXPRESSION> direction.
How much does <EXPRESSION> change in the <EXPRESSION> direction if we hold <EXPRESSION> constant.
So the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, still a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.
The derivative in that direction is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.
So now <EXPRESSION> is a constant.
So this actually becomes pretty straightforward.
This whole <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, if <EXPRESSION> is some number, <EXPRESSION>, this is just a constant.
So we can just write that out front.
So that's just <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
I know it's hard for you to get used to saying that, oh, <EXPRESSION>, that's just a constant number.
Because you're so used to taking the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
And that's the hardest part about doing these partial derivatives.
But anyway, this is just a constant term.
And now we just take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
The derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
I'll do that in yellow.
<EXPRESSION>.
I just want to put the minus out front.
<EXPRESSION>.
There you have it.
Let's do another one.
And actually I'm going to add more variables.
Let's say that, I don't know, just so you get used to the different notation.
<EQUATION> times, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.
Now what is the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well everything else is just a constant.
What's the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's <EXPRESSION>.
So it'll just be <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
I can actually get rid of my parentheses there.
What's the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Ah, sorry, what's the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well now, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are just constants.
We can just write that.
<EXPRESSION>.
And now we just take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
Well that's <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
If I just want to rearrange it, that's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
Not too difficult.
You just have to keep in mind what's constant and what's not.
And then finally, the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, those are both constants.
<EXPRESSION> times derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
Or we could rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.
Just a little bit of algebraic manipulation.
Anyway, I will see you in the next video.
