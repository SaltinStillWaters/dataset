Transcript for: Taylor Polynomials Welcome to the video on the Taylor Theorem and Taylor polynomials.
And we've actually already touched on this.
When we did the videos on approximating functions with polynomials, we used Maclaurin series, which is actually a special case of the Taylor polynomial or the Taylor Theorem.
And we just pick, we approximate the function around <EQUATION> when we did the Maclaurin series.
But in general, you could approximate a function around any value.
And if you do it around something other than <EXPRESSION>, it's kind of the more general case, and we're dealing with the Taylor polynomial.
So what is that? Let me just write the definition down, and then we'll do a couple of examples, and then we'll graph it to get the intuition.
So a Taylor polynomial says that if I have a differentiable function <EXPRESSION>, and I want to approximate it with a polynomial at <EXPRESSION>, so at some value of <EQUATION>, I want to approximate this function.
So let me just draw a quick and dirty one, and we'll actually draw an accurate one later.
So let's say that that's my axes, this is my function <EXPRESSION>.
So I could pick some value <EXPRESSION>, some value <EQUATION>, maybe it's right there.
So that's c.
And I would want to approximate it, I would want to create a polynomial that can approximate the function around this point.
And the Taylor Theorem tells us that the Taylor polynomial to approximate this is, and then I'll give you the intuition for it in a second.
<EXPRESSION>.
And this looks really complicated, but when you do some examples, you'll see it's not so bad.
<EQUATION> over, they say <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>, but OK, I'll write <EXPRESSION>.
They do that so that you see the pattern that emerges.
This is over <EXPRESSION>, really, and this is over <EXPRESSION>, really.
Times <EXPRESSION>, I'm already running out of space, <EXPRESSION>, I think at this point people just write a <EXPRESSION> in parentheses, of the function evaluated at c over <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, and you could just keep adding terms.
You could go on like this for infinity.
But let me give you the intuition of what this is.
Let me just show you, just to hit the point home.
Then you could plus the fourth derivative of the function evaluated at <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.
Now what's the intuition? So first of all, what happens to this polynomial at <EXPRESSION>? So what's <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> = if <EXPRESSION>, everywhere where you see an x here, you have to put a <EXPRESSION>, right? So this term would be <EXPRESSION>, so that would go to <EXPRESSION>, or it would be <EXPRESSION>.
This term would be <EXPRESSION>, it would be <EXPRESSION>.
This term would be <EXPRESSION>, so it would be <EXPRESSION>.
This term would be <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
And all you'd be left with is this <EXPRESSION>.
So great.
We already know that, at least at the value of <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.
So it's going to intersect this line.
Right? And actually, if we just had a Taylor polynomial with just that first term, what would it look like? Well, it would just be a horizontal line right there.
So it would be a pretty bad approximation.
But, what does this second term do us? Because we know that if we just evaluated c.
All these other terms just drop out.
So what do they do for us? Well, the second term actually ensures that the derivative of this polynomial, evaluated at <EQUATION>.
What do I mean there? Well, what's <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> =, well, this is just a constant term.
It might look like a function, but it's a function evaluated at c, so it's just a constant term.
And so, that's <EXPRESSION>.
And then, what is this? What's the derivative of this? Well, we could use, this is a constant term, and the derivative of this is just <EXPRESSION>.
So you could almost just view this as <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>, minus <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> which is a constant, whatever.
So the derivative of this expression is <EXPRESSION>, and then plus the derivative of this expression, and that's = what? <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> divided by <EXPRESSION> factorial, which is just <EXPRESSION>.
So it's <EXPRESSION> prime of <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, and then plus, let's see.
<EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>, we'll just have a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.
<EXPRESSION> prime <EXPRESSION>, what was it, <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> squared And you don't have to worry about all of this.
And then, we could just keep going.
But I wanted just to show you one thing.
What is <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION>.
What is the derivative of this polynomial when you evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>? Well, when you put <EXPRESSION> into this derivative function, all these other terms are going to drop off, and you're just left with this one.
Right? Because this <EXPRESSION> sorry, just had some walnuts.
I should have some water with it.
If you put the <EXPRESSION> here, they drop out.
So the derivative of this function evaluated at <EQUATION>.
So as you can see, what's neat about this Taylor polynomial is, it's = the function at <EXPRESSION>, its derivative = the function at <EXPRESSION>, the second derivative = the function at <EXPRESSION>.
And every term you add to the Taylor polynomial actually makes it so that that term, derivative, of the polynomial evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, = the function.
Hope I didn't confuse you.
The big picture is, the whole thinking behind, I guess, what Taylor thought of, was, wow.
If this function is infinitely differentiable, meaning that I can take the first, second, third, fourth, you know, all the way to infinity derivative of this function, I could construct a polynomial like this, and i can just keep going by adding more and more terms, so that this polynomial's, you know, zeroth derivative, which is means the function, the <EXPRESSION>, first, second, third, fourth, all of this polynomial's derivatives are going to be = the function.
At least around that point.
And actually, we'll see that there's actually a whole class of functions, that the Taylor polynomial, if you were to take the infinite series, is actually = that function at all points.
But anyway.
And actually, I talk a little bit about that when I prove that <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, which to me was the most amazing result in mathematics.
Whatever, whatever.
This might have been a little confusing for you, so let's do a particular example.
The particulars are always the more fun.
I think when you see me do an example, you'll see that it's not so bad.
I'm even going to erase this fourth term.
So let's approximate, I don't know, cosine of x.
So let's say that <EXPRESSION> =, let me do it in a different color.
We want to approximate <EQUATION>.
And let's pick some arbitrary number.
Let's not pick some number that works well with trigonometric functions.
Let's pick around, let's say <EQUATION>.
No, <EXPRESSION>.
So we're going to approximate <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> around <EXPRESSION>.
So what is the Taylor approximation, or the Taylor polynomial? Well, we could just chug through this one.
<EXPRESSION>, I'll do it in yellow.
<EQUATION>.
So the function evaluated at c is just <EXPRESSION>, right? plus <EXPRESSION> prime of <EXPRESSION>.
Well, what is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? It's minus <EXPRESSION>, right? Minus <EXPRESSION>, and we want to evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>.
So it's minus <EXPRESSION>, right? c is one, that's we're approximating around.
Times <EXPRESSION>.
And then, plus <EXPRESSION>.
So what's the second derivative? What's going to be the derivative of minus sine, which is <EXPRESSION>? So it's <EXPRESSION>.
But we're evaluating it at <EXPRESSION>, so there's actually going to be a number, right? So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
Over <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> factorial is just <EXPRESSION>.
Times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, oh, sorry, this should be a one, right? I said, <EQUATION>.
Times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>.
Let's keep going.
Plus the third derivative, plus, what's the third derivative of cosine? Well, it's the derivative of minus cosine, so that's plus sign.
So plus sine evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
Divided by <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>.
Sorry, my brain is really, I ate too many walnuts.
Undo, edit, undo.
<EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, right? And then, let's do one more term, just for fun.
So then we're going to take the fourth derivative, which is the derivative of the third derivative, so the third derivative was <EXPRESSION>, so now we're going to be <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> evaluated at <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION> what's <EXPRESSION>? It's <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.
So over <EXPRESSION>.
Times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>.
And we could just keep going.
The fifth derivative over 5 evaluated at <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, and just keep adding, but then it will take us forever, et cetera, et cetera.
So, what does this thing look like? And what I'm going to do, is I'm going to show you how this polynomial develops as we add terms.
So let's see.
I have this graphing calculator that I so this thing I got from, just to give them credit, it's my.
hrw.
com.
And this is the graph of <EXPRESSION>.
So just the first term here.
<EXPRESSION>.
If we were to just to graph the first term of this polynomial, what does it look like? So I'll just type in <EXPRESSION>, and graph it.
So there you go.
Just the first term of the polynomial.
If all of these terms weren't here, the polynomial would just be a constant, right? <EXPRESSION>.
And it's a pretty bad approximation, but at least it = the function at this point.
So it gives a something.
But let's add some terms.
Let's add the second term to it.
So what was the second term? It was <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.
Let me add that.
Graph it.
There you go.
So this is neat.
So when you just added <EXPRESSION> terms, what did we say? The polynomial will be = the function at <EQUATION>.
And now the slope is also = the function.
The slope of the polynomial is also = the slope of the function at <EQUATION>.
So this is a better approximation.
At least if we stay pretty close to our chosen c, it's a decent approximation for the function.
Obviously, if we get far away, out here, this is a horrible approximation for the function.
But let's keep adding terms.
As you can see, I just want to show you that I'm just typing in the actual terms.
So let me type in the next term.
just so you believe that I'm doing it.
So the next term, we'll have to see it.
Let me type it in.
So the next term is <EXPRESSION>.
And let me graph it.
OK.
So now, just to show you, I just typed in the second term, and now let's look at the graph.
Now this is neat, right? So the first term got us a horizontal line that just intersected the point at cosine of 1, and it was a really bad approximation.
Then the second term made sure that at least the first derivative was the same.
And so then we, the line was just essentially the tangent line, we only had <EXPRESSION> terms.
Now the third term makes sure that the second derivative of our polynomial at <EQUATION> = the second derivative of the polynomial of the function.
And notice that this green graph is concave downwards, right? Which means that, and so is the function at <EXPRESSION>.
So this is this is pretty neat.
We're getting a little bit, so it's kind of approximating the curve here.
It's getting a little bit better.
Remember when we went out far to the left? Starting to approximate the function better around here.
It's closer, at least.
Right? The last time, the line just went up, and here it was a really bad approximation.
But let's add another term.
Let's add our third term.
Our third term, I can see it, it's right there.
So plus <EXPRESSION> divided by <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> to the third power.
Just to show you, I just typed it in, right there.
Let me graph it.
That is neat.
Just with three terms on our polynomial, well, actually, that's the fourth term, officially.
But the first term was essentially well, you get the point.
But we're already starting to approximate this pretty well, right? Now the third derivative of the polynomial = the third derivative of the function at the point <EQUATION>, and we haven't even studied third derivatives.
That's kind of like the concativity of the derivative, or whatever.
But as we can see, it approximates the function even better.
Obviously, though, when we go further away, it starts to break down again.
But pretty close.
If all you saw is from here to here, it would be hard to tell them apart.
Let's add that last term we calculated.
And this should be pretty neat.
Let's see.
The last term.
Plus <EXPRESSION> divided by <EXPRESSION>.
And notice, every term, the scaling factor, right? Here's <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> it becomes a smaller impact on it.
And it only starts to matter as you move really, really far away from your chosen <EXPRESSION>.
In this case <EXPRESSION>, right.
The further out you go, when you're close to your point that you've picked.
these other terms don't matter much, right? Because you're doing <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>, et cetera et cetera.
But as you get further and further away, these terms become more significant, right? As <EXPRESSION> gets further and further away from <EXPRESSION>, and then that's where these start to play in, and you see that in the approximation.
Anyway, let me graph it.
So <EXPRESSION>.
Let me graph it.
Even neater! And if you have some spare time, you might just want to keep adding terms to this.
So that's all the Taylor polynomial is.
And I realize, this is probably one of longest videos I've done.
I'm pushing 17 minutes.
It's a little confusing at first, because it gives you this huge formula, and they give you the <EXPRESSION>, and you're like, what is that <EXPRESSION>, and how do I take the derivative? But when you actually try to chug through it, you just have to realize, oh.
All this is, is saying, we are constructing a polynomial that, at some point <EXPRESSION> that we've picked, this polynomial's zeroth, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and so on-th derivative is going to be = our function.
And actually, if we did 10 terms, or if we did all of the derivatives, these would start to actually = each other.
So hopefully that didn't confuse you.
I know when you see the formula at first, it can be kind of daunting, and especially, sometimes it's even more daunting when someone even explains it to you.
But hopefully that gave you some intuition.
If it didn't, ignore this video.
See you soon.
