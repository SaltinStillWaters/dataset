Transcript for: The Chain Rule Welcome back.
I'm now going to do some more examples of a bit of a review of some of the derivatives that we've been seeing.
And then I'll introduce you to something called the chain rule which expands the universe of the types of functions we can take the derivatives of.
So in the last presentation, I showed you how to function if I had f of x = 10x to the seventh plus 6x to the third plus 15x minus x to the 16th.
To take the derivative of this entire function, we take the derivative of all the terms.
Because you can add them up.
So let's define <EQUATION>.
It's actually fairly straightforward.
Factor out <EXPRESSION>.
Then, cancel <EXPRESSION>.
So we get <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> degree less.
So we set the right hand side to <EXPRESSION>.
We can kind of view this as <EXPRESSION>, right? So it's <EXPRESSION>.
So we set that = <EXPRESSION>.
And I don't want you to lose sight of what we're actually doing here.
What is f prime of x? This is the function the tells us the slope of any point <EXPRESSION>, along the curve <EXPRESSION>.
It's a pretty interesting thing.
Let me just draw <EQUATION> to maybe give you a little bit of intuition.
I don't know what the slope of <EXPRESSION> really looks like.
And actually, let's pretend like this isn't <EXPRESSION>.
Let's pretend like this is just some arbitrary function I'm drawing.
If this is <EXPRESSION>, just some curve that does all sorts of crazy things, <EXPRESSION> tells me the slope at any point along that line.
So if I wanted to know the slope at this point right here, I could use the derivative function to figure out the slope of the tangent line.
The tangent line is something like that right there.
Or if I wanted to figure out the slope at this point, once again I'd use the derivative function.
And it would tell me the slope of the tangent line at that point.
Which would be something like that.
We just apply the derivative operation to the whole equation.
So it's a pretty useful thing.
And once I give you all the tools to analytically solve a whole host of derivatives, then we'll actually do a bunch of word problems and applications of derivatives.
And I think you'll see that it's a really, really, really useful concept.
So let's move on.
I think you get the idea of how to do these derivatives of polynomials.
Let me erase this.
I'm actually using a different tool now.
So I think it might be a bit easier.
Let's see, someone was calling me.
But you're more important so I will not answer the phone.
I'm going to introduce you this tool doesn't have, I don't think it has a straight up eraser.
Actually, maybe let's see.
If I do it like this.
Oh let me see.
No that doesn't work.
Let me just erase like this, the old-fashioned way.
You just have to bear with me.
And then once I finish erasing, I will show you the chain rule.
This is good.
It feels like I'm a real teacher with a real chalkboard and a real eraser now.
This is a lot cleaner than a normal chalkboard as well.
Bear with me, almost there.
I'll figure out a faster way to do this over the next couple of videos.
It's pretty sad.
I'm showing you how to do derivatives in calculus, but I don't know how to erase a faster way than this.
There, we're done.
OK.
So now I'm going show you how to solve the derivatives of a slightly more complicated type of a function.
It's actually not more complicated.
It's just different.
So let's say <EQUATION>.
And I want to figure out the derivative of this.
We're going to use something called the chain rule.
Because one thing we could do, we could just multiply <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION>.
And if you've ever done that, you know it's a pain.
So that's not something we'd want to do.
So we're going to use something called the chain rule.
And I'm just going to give you a bunch of examples before I even show you the definition of the chain rule.
Because I think this is something that you just have to learn by example.
So the chain rule just tells us that the derivative of let's say this function right here.
You take the derivative of the subfunctions, and then you can take a derivative of the entire function.
I'll tell you that formally.
But I think when you introduce it formally, it gets more confusing.
So what I do, I just take the derivative of <EXPRESSION> first.
And actually let me use colors.
I think that might simplify <EXPRESSION>.
So I take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?
Well you know that.
Change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
And then the derivative of <EQUATION>.
So the derivative of <EQUATION>.
And then I'm going to multiply <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION>.
And I just pretend like <EXPRESSION> is just like a variable by itself.
So then what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? 
Well the derivative of <EXPRESSION> I'm going to do that in a different color the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
So it'll be <EXPRESSION>.
But here we take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
We take derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
So we just replace <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION>.
So what did we do here? We went in the inside of the function, and we took the derivative here.
And the get the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
And then we multiply <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.
It was like <EXPRESSION>.
We set the right side to <EXPRESSION>.
And if we just simplify <EQUATION>.
I know this was probably a little confusing to you, so I'm going to try to do a couple more examples.
Let's say I had <EQUATION>.
So <EQUATION>? 
We take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
This is called the chain rule.
Let's just apply the chain rule here in <EXPRESSION>.
So now, we simplify <EXPRESSION>.
Factor out <EXPRESSION>.
But we simplify <EXPRESSION>.
Let me draw <EQUATION> here.
We could say that <EQUATION>.
I hope I didn't confuse you too much.
In the next presentation, I'm just going to do a ton of examples using the chain rule.
And I think the more examples you see, it's going to hit the point home.
And then after I've done a bunch of examples, then I'm going to give you a formal definition.
I think that's actually an easier way to digest the chain rule than giving you the formal definition first, and then showing you a bunch of examples.
So I'll see you in the next presentation.
