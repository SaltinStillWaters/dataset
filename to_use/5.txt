Transcript for: Limit examples (part 3) | Limits | Differential Calculus | 

Let's do some more limit examples.
So let's get another problem.
If I had the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of, let's say, <EXPRESSION>.
So the first thing I like to do whenever I see any of these limits problems is just substitute the number in and see if I get something that makes sense, and then we'd be done.
Well, usually we'd be done.
I don't want to make these sweeping statements.
If the function is continuous, we'd be done.
But if we put the <EXPRESSION> in the numerator, we get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
So <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
And the denominator also let's see, <EXPRESSION>, that also = <EXPRESSION>.
So we don't like having <EXPRESSION>.
My pen tool is malfunctioning again.
So we don't like getting <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, so is there any way we can simplify this <EXPRESSION> to maybe get it to an expression that, when we evaluate <<EQUATION>> at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, we actually get something that makes sense? Well, whenever I see two of these polynomials here, and they look, just by inspecting them, relatively easy to factor, I like to factor <EXPRESSION> out because maybe there's the same factor in the numerator and the denominator, and then we can simplify it.
So let's say that this is the same thing as that looks like it's <EXPRESSION>.
It actually looks like it's <EXPRESSION>, but we're just going to write <EXPRESSION>, which is, of course, <EXPRESSION>.
And then in the denominator, you know how to factor these, this is <EXPRESSION>, all right? So the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of this expression is the same thing as the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of this <EXPRESSION>.
And, of course, there's nothing we can do to change the fact that this function, or this expression, is <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
But if we can simplify <EQUATION>, we can figure out what <EQUATION> approaches.
Well, if we assume that <EXPRESSION> is any number but <EXPRESSION>, we can cross out these two terms because then they wouldn't be <EXPRESSION>, right? It only is <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> because so in the numerator and the denominator, we can cross this out.
And we can say and I'm not being very rigorous here, but this is kind of how it's taught, and I think you get the intuition that this is the same thing as the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Now let's just try to stick the <EXPRESSION> in and see what we get.
Well, in the numerator, we get <EXPRESSION>.
We still get <EXPRESSION>.
But in the denominator here, we get <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
So now we get a good number.
<EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, well, that's a real number, so it's <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
So that was interesting.
The first time we did it, we got the answer <EXPRESSION>.
And now we get the answer <EXPRESSION> by simplifying <EQUATION>.
But, of course, it's very important to remember that this expression is <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
It's defined everywhere but, but if we were to graph <EQUATION>, and I encourage you to do so, you would see that as you get closer and closer to <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, the value of this <EXPRESSION> will = <EXPRESSION>.
And I know what you're thinking.
Well, this was <EXPRESSION>.
Is every time I get <EXPRESSION> going to end up just becoming <EXPRESSION> when I evaluate the <EXPRESSION>? Well, let's explore that.
Let me clear this.
Let's say what is pen is not working the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
No, let's say <EXPRESSION>.
As you can see, I do all this in my head, and I'm prone to mistakes.
And all of that <EXPRESSION>.
Well, once again, if we just evaluate <EQUATION>, let's see what happens when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
You get <EXPRESSION>.
So once again, we get <EXPRESSION>, and we have to do something to this maybe to simplify <EXPRESSION>.
Well, let's factor out the top of <EXPRESSION>.
So that's the same thing as the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.
Well, that's <EXPRESSION>, right? And I think you'll often discover when you see a lot of limit problems that even if this top factor, if this top expression, is hard to factor, chances are, one of the things in the denominator that are making this expression undefined is probably a factor up here.
So sometimes you might get a more complex thing that isn't as easy to factor as this, but a good starting point is to guess that one of the factors is going to be in the bottom expression because that's kind of the trick of these problems, to just simplify the expression.
So once again, if we assume that <EXPRESSION> does not = <EXPRESSION>, and this <EXPRESSION> would not be = <EXPRESSION>.
Then, cancel out <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.
And we get that this is just the same thing as the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Well, now this is pretty easy.
What's the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>? 
Well, you just plug <EXPRESSION> into <EQUATION> in there, and you get <EXPRESSION>.
So it's interesting.
When we just tried to evaluate the <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, we got <EXPRESSION>.
And in the previous example, we saw that it evaluated out when you simplified <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>, and in this example, it came out to <EXPRESSION>.
And I really encourage you, if you have a graphing calculator, graph these <EQUATION> that we're doing and see and show yourself visually that it's true, that the limit as you approach, say, <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> actually does approach the limits that were solving for.
And make up your own problems.
Hell, that's what I'm doing.
So you could prove it to yourself.
So let's do another.
Let's do one that I think is pretty interesting.
Let's say what's the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>? The limit as x<EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of, let's say, <EXPRESSION>.
So the way I think about these problems as they approach <EXPRESSION>, just think about what happens when you get really, really, really large values of <EXPRESSION>.
And kind of a cheating way of doing this is, if you have a calculator, even if you don't have a calculator, put in huge numbers here.
See what happens when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, see what happens when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, see what happens when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, and I think you'll get the point.
You'll see what if there is a limit here, you'll see what it's going to.
But the way I think about it is, in the numerator, kind of the fastest-growing term here is the x squared term, right? This is the fastest-growing term here.
In the denominator, what's the fastest-growing term? Well, in the denominator, the fastest-growing term is this <EXPRESSION>.
Well, what's going to grow faster, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>? Well, yeah, <EXPRESSION> going to grow a lot faster than <EXPRESSION>.
So this denominator, as you get larger and larger and larger values of <EXPRESSION>, is going to grow a lot faster than that numerator.
So you could imagine if the denominator's growing much, much, much faster than the numerator, as you get larger and larger numbers, you're going to get a smaller and smaller and smaller fraction, right? It's going to approach <EXPRESSION>.
And so as you go to infinity, it approaches <EXPRESSION>.
I know that I kind of just hand waved, but that's really how you think about it.
Another way you could do it is you could actually divide this <EXPRESSION>.
You could actually divide this rational <EXPRESSION>, and you'll get something like <EXPRESSION>, something, something, and then you'd also see, oh, well, the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
Let's do one more.
I'll do this fast so I can confuse you.
The limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
These problems kind of look confusing sometimes, but they're really easy.
You just have to think about what happens as you get really large values of <EXPRESSION>.
Well, as you get really large values of <EXPRESSION>, these small terms, these ones that don't grow as fast as these large terms, kind of don't matter anymore, right, because you're getting really large values of <EXPRESSION>.
And this case, these don't matter anymore, and then these two <EXPRESSION> terms grow at the same pace, right? And they'll always be kind of growing in this ratio of <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
So the limit here is actually that easy.
It's <EXPRESSION>.
So what you do is you just figure out what's the fastest-growing term on the top, what's the fastest-growing term on the bottom, and then figure out what it approaches.
If they're the same term, then they kind of cancel out, and you say the limit approaches <EXPRESSION>.
It's a very nonrigorous way of doing it, but it gets you the right answer.
See you in the next presentation.
