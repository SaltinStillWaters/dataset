Transcript for: Introduction to limits 2 | Limits | Precalculus | 

Welcome to the presentation on limits.
Let's get started with some well, first an explanation before I do any problems.
So let's say I had let me make sure I have the right color and my pen works.
OK, let's say I had the limit, and I'll explain what a limit is in a second.
But the way you write it is you say the limit oh, my color is on the wrong OK, let me use the pen and yellow.
OK, the limit as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>> of <EXPRESSION>>.
Now, all this is saying is what value does the expression <EXPRESSION>> approach as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>>? Well, this is pretty easy.
If we look at let me at least draw a graph.
I'll stay in this yellow color.
So let me draw <EQUATION>.
<EXPRESSION>> looks something like let me use a different color.
<EXPRESSION>> looks something like this, right? And when <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
It's just the expression <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>, right? So a limit is saying, as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>> from both sides, from numbers left than <EXPRESSION>> and from numbers right than <EXPRESSION>>, what does the expression approach? And you might, I think, already see where this is going and be wondering why we're even going to the trouble of learning this new concept because it seems pretty obvious, but as <EXPRESSION>> as we get to <EXPRESSION>> closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>> from this direction, and as we get to <EXPRESSION>> closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>> to this direction, what does this <EXPRESSION>> =? Well, it essentially = <EXPRESSION>>, right? The <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
The way I think about it is as you move on the curve closer and closer to the expression's value, what does the <EXPRESSION>> =? In this case, <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
You're probably saying, Sal, this seems like a useless concept because I could have just stuck 2 in there, and I know that if this is say this is <EXPRESSION>>, that if <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>, that <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>, and that would have been a no-brainer.
Well, let me maybe give you one wrinkle on that, and hopefully now you'll start to see what the use of a limit is.
Let me define <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>> when, if <EXPRESSION>> does not = <EXPRESSION>>, and let's say it = <EXPRESSION>> when <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
Interesting.
So it's a slight variation on this expression right here.
So this is our new <EXPRESSION>>.
So let me ask you a question.
What is the limit as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>> of <EXPRESSION>>?
It says x approaches 2.
It's just like that.
I just I don't know.
For some reason, my brain is working functionally.
OK, so let me graph <EXPRESSION>> now.
So that's an equally neat-looking graph as the one I just drew.
Let me draw <EXPRESSION>.
So now it's almost the same as this curve, except something interesting happens at <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
So it's just like this.
It's like an <EXPRESSION>> curve like that.
But at <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>> and <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>, we draw a little hole.
We draw a hole because it's not defined at <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
This is <EQUATION>>.
This is <EXPRESSION>>.
This is <EXPRESSION>>.
This is the <EQUATION>> axis, of course.
And when <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>> let's say this is <EXPRESSION>>.
When <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>, <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
This is actually right below this.
I should it doesn't look completely right below it, but I think you got to get the picture.
See, this graph is <EXPRESSION>>.
It's exactly <EXPRESSION>> until we get to <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
At <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
We have a gap in the graph, which maybe could be called a grap.
We have a gap in the graph, and then we keep and then after <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>, we keep moving on.
And that gap, and that gap is defined right here, what happens when <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>? Well, then <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>.
So this graph kind of goes it's just <EXPRESSION>>, but instead of <EXPRESSION>> = <EXPRESSION>>, <EXPRESSION>> drops down to <EXPRESSION>>, but then we keep on going.
So going back to the limit problem, what is the limit as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>>? Now, well, let's think about the same thing.
We're going to go this is how I visualize it.
I go along the curve.
Let me pick a different color.
So as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>> from this side, from the left-hand side or from numbers less than <EXPRESSION>>, <EXPRESSION>> is approaching values approaching <EXPRESSION>>, right? <EXPRESSION>> is approaching <EXPRESSION>> as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>>, right? I think you see that.
If you just follow along the curve, as you approach <EXPRESSION>>, you get closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>>.
Similarly, as you go from the right-hand side make sure my thing's still working.
As you go from the right-hand side, you go along the curve, and <EXPRESSION>> is also slowly approaching <EXPRESSION>>.
So, as you can see, as we go closer and closer and closer to <EQUATION>>, <EXPRESSION>> of whatever number that is approaches <EXPRESSION>>, right? So, in this case, the limit as <EXPRESSION>> approaches <EXPRESSION>> is also = <EXPRESSION>>.
Well, this is interesting because, in this case, the limit as x approaches 2 of f of x does not = f of 2.
Now, normally, this would be on this line.
In this case, the limit as you approach the expression = evaluating the expression of that value.
In this case, the limit isn't.
I think now you're starting to see why the limit is a slightly different concept than just evaluating the function at that point because you have functions where, for whatever reason at a certain point, either the function might not be defined or the function kind of jumps up or down, but as you approach that point, you still approach a value different than the function at that point.
Now, that's my introduction.
I think this will give you intuition for what a limit is.
In another presentation, I'll give you the more formal mathematical, you know, the delta-epsilon definition of a limit.
And actually, in the very next module, I'm now going to do a bunch of problems involving the limit.
I think as you do more and more problems, you'll get more and more of an intuition as to what a limit is.
And then as we go into drill derivatives and integrals, you'll actually understand why people probably even invented limits to begin with.
We'll see you in the next presentation.
