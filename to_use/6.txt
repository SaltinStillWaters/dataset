Transcript for: Limit examples w/ brain malfunction on first prob (part 4) | Differential Calculus | 

My cousin Nadia is taking a summer calculus course and she called me last night.
And she had some limit problems and they were excellent problem.
So I thought it was worthwhile to make videos on the problems that she had to figure out.
Anyway, so let's do them.
If I remember them correctly.
I'm doing this on memory.
So I hope the answers work out like they did last night when we were going over them on the phone.
So if I remember correctly, the first one was the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.
Oh no.
Not that There's no <EXPRESSION>.
It's a <EXPRESSION>.
Of <EXPRESSION>.
All of that over <EXPRESSION>.
So the first thing when you want to do when you try a limit problem is, well you just try to substitute <EXPRESSION> into <EXPRESSION>.
And you just evaluate the <EQUATION> at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
If it's a continuous function, then the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> is going to be the <EXPRESSION>.
But you immediately see a problem if you put <EXPRESSION> right here <EXPRESSION> and you get a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, which is <EXPRESSION>, so we have to figure out some way to get around that.
And nine times out of 10, when you see a problem like this, the solution, because both the numerator and the denominator look factorable, is to factor the numerator and the denominator.
So <EXPRESSION> = the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.
What's the numerator factored? Let's see.
Something when you add <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, you get <EXPRESSION>, and you multiply them, you get <EXPRESSION>.
So it's probably <EXPRESSION>, right? So this is going to be <EXPRESSION>.
That's just factoring a quadratic.
And what is this? This has the form <EXPRESSION>, right? So that's going to be.
But <EXPRESSION> If this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> would be <EXPRESSION>, right? So it's <EXPRESSION>.
And then, of course, this also has the form <EXPRESSION>, right? So this will further factor into <EXPRESSION>.
Well, our factoring of <EQUATION> paid off.
We see a <EXPRESSION> in the numerator and the denominator that are the same.
And not only are they the same, but they This is the term that was giving us the problems, right? Because you put a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, you got a <EXPRESSION>.
So let's assume that we're not evaluating it at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
And so, for all other values, we can divide those because those are going to be the same values.
And then what are we left with? <EXPRESSION> = the limit and I've change colors arbitrarily as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Which is = what? That's = <EXPRESSION>? = <EXPRESSION>.
And then <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
There you go.
I thought that was a pretty interesting problem.
Let's do another one.
And this one I found even more interesting.
She gave me It's really testing my memory to see if I can But I remember the gist of the problem.
So I might not get the exact numbers she'd given me, but hopefully I get the exact properties.
So it's the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of the <EXPRESSION>.
So when you look at this you're like well let's see.
What's happening here? Let's see this.
As you go to <EXPRESSION>, this term will get really big.
But then we're taking the square root of <EXPRESSION>.
And it seems like this term would overpower this term.
And then, so maybe this kind of converges to <EXPRESSION>, but then we would subtract an <EXPRESSION>.
So maybe it approaches <EXPRESSION>.
So that's, at least, that was my first intuition when I spoke to her.
But as we will see, the intuition here is wrong.
And really to do this you have to know a little bit of a trick.
And this trick pays off a lot whenever you see something with the square root sign, then subtracting <EXPRESSION> else, if you want to get rid of that square root sign.
So what we are going to do is going to multiply <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.
Essentially the conjugate we normally apply to complex numbers.
But if we have something like <EXPRESSION>, we get the conjugate of <EXPRESSION>.
And the reason why And what we're going to do is we're going to multiply <EXPRESSION> by the conjugate of <EXPRESSION>.
And why does Why is that normal? Why is that useful? Because we have <EXPRESSION>.
If we multiply <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>, we get <EXPRESSION>.
Which will make this radical sign disappear without too much work.
So let's do that.
Let's multiply <EXPRESSION> by the conjugate of <EXPRESSION>.
But we can't just multiply it, right? We have to multiply <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>.
Because you can only To not change the value of something, you can only multiply <EXPRESSION> by 1.
So let's multiply <EXPRESSION> by the conjugate: <EXPRESSION>, right? That's the conjugate, right? Instead of <EXPRESSION>.
And we can't just multiply that.
We have to multiply <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, otherwise we would be changing the value.
So <EXPRESSION> is going to be divided by the same thing.
<EXPRESSION>.
Let me erase this stuff down here so we don't get distracted.
Don't want to get distracted.
And so what do we have? This will become the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.
Well, we'll evaluate <EXPRESSION>.
So we end up with <EXPRESSION>.
Well, what's <EXPRESSION> squared? That's <EXPRESSION>.
Well what's <EXPRESSION> squared? Well, <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
So if we evaluate <EXPRESSION> it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.
This is just algebra.
Divided by <EXPRESSION>: <EXPRESSION>
So let's see.
There's a little simplification we can do.
Simplify <EXPRESSION>.
We can subtract <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>.
We can cancel out <EXPRESSION>.
So <EXPRESSION>.
And now let's see what we can do.
Well since we're taking <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, and this is what you normally do what you take <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
We can divide the numerator and the denominator by <EXPRESSION>.
And in this case, our highest degree terms is <EXPRESSION>, right? We have an <EXPRESSION> here and an <EXPRESSION> here.
And then when you take And then, of course, when you divide something like this by <EXPRESSION>, and you take it to, <EXPRESSION>, this will approach <EXPRESSION>.
So let's do that.
Let's divide the numerator and the denominator by <EXPRESSION>.
And remember: anything you do in the numerator, you have to do in the denominator.
Otherwise you're changing the value.
So times <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>.
I'm just dividing the numerator and the denominator by <EXPRESSION>.
So this = the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of What's That's going to be <EXPRESSION> Let me ask you a question.
What is <EXPRESSION>? What is This is a bit of an algebra review, but <EXPRESSION>.
What's <EXPRESSION>? I'm just doing a little on the side here.
Well if we take the <EXPRESSION> and we put it into the radical sign, it becomes <EXPRESSION>, right? This is the same thing as You can say <EXPRESSION>.
You could say <EXPRESSION>.
You could put <EXPRESSION>.
And that should make sense to you, right? Because if we started with this, we could easily just take the square root <EXPRESSION> and take <EXPRESSION> outside.
And the square root of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
I'm just going in the other direction, right? So, assuming you're comfortable with that, everything under the radical sign.
Even though we're actually dividing by <EXPRESSION>, since we're going into the radical sign, we're actually dividing by <EXPRESSION>.
So it becomes this is the <EXPRESSION>, right? I hope you understand why we're dividing by <EXPRESSION> here.
We're actually dividing by <EXPRESSION>.
But when you put it under the radical sign, it becomes <EXPRESSION>.
Let me put it this way.
<EXPRESSION>.
That's the same thing.
That = the <EXPRESSION>, right? And this is just <EXPRESSION>.
So that's the property, or the algebra that we're using.
So anyway, we divide all of this by <EXPRESSION>.
So that becomes a <EXPRESSION>.
And then, of course, we divide this one by This term right here, we divide by <EXPRESSION>, right? Because it's not in the radical sign.
So that just becomes a <EXPRESSION>.
So now what's the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>? Well as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, this term <EXPRESSION> right here goes to <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
This term <EXPRESSION> right here goes to <EXPRESSION>.
This term <EXPRESSION> right here goes to <EXPRESSION>.
And so what are we left with? This = <EXPRESSION>.
Evaluate <EXPRESSION>.
Well that's just <EXPRESSION>.
So that = <EXPRESSION>, which simplifies to <EXPRESSION>.
There you go.
Now let's do one more problem.
This is the third one she'd given me.
In it, we had to kind of brush off our trig identities.
And really these harder limit problems, they're all about kind of knowing your algebra and your trigonometry really well.
Just so you know how to manipulate these functions.
Because the limit part You just have to get it into a form where taking the limit is fairly straightforward.
So let's do that trig problem.
Clear image.
Invert colors.
So it was the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Was that it? Yeah.
Simplify <EXPRESSION>.
And this one, just like previous problems, more than knowing your pre-calculus or your calculus, you need to know your trig identities.
So <EXPRESSION>.
That's just <EXPRESSION>.
I remember that by saying it's not intuitive.
You would have thought that the <EXPRESSION>.
But it's not.
It's <EXPRESSION>.
So I remember that it's not intuitive.
And <EXPRESSION>.
And <EXPRESSION>, so cotangent's the opposite.
And so that = <EXPRESSION>, right? OK.
So what is <EXPRESSION> =? So this is going to be the limit as x approaches 0.
Cotangent of 2x, we said, was cosine of 2x over sine of 2x.
And then it's going to be all of that over the cosecant of x.
Well that's just <EXPRESSION>.
Well if you divide <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, that's the same thing as multiply by <EXPRESSION>.
So we have What do we have? We have cosine Well we have <EXPRESSION>.
All of that divided by <EXPRESSION>.
Just doing a little arithmetic.
And we have a problem here still.
Because when you take <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, this term right here goes to <EXPRESSION> and we have a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, which is just not acceptable.
Because it's <EXPRESSION>.
And that's the whole reason why we're doing this limit to begin with.
And actually that's the first thing you should have done.
You should have tried to put it and you would have seen that you would've gotten a <EXPRESSION> value in the denominator and it would have been unevaluatable.
Right.
Because really, this is just We haven't even done any manipulation yet.
This is the same thing as this.
And if you put the <EXPRESSION> right here, you get <EXPRESSION>.
So what can we do? Well this is where your break out the trig or you brush off your memory.
What is the <EXPRESSION> =? And this is your double One of the double angle formulas.
<EXPRESSION>.
So if you know that, then you've gone a long way because then it becomes pretty simple to simplify.
So simplify <EXPRESSION> to become <EXPRESSION>.
And if we assume that <EXPRESSION> isn't <EXPRESSION>, it's just approaching <EXPRESSION>, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by <EXPRESSION>.
And what are we left with? We're left with the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Well what's <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right? So <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, that's also <EXPRESSION>.
So <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.
So <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
There you go.
I think those are three fairly meaty limit problems.
And if you know that, you're probably prepared for something that your calculus teacher might throw at you.
See you in a future video.
