Transcript for: Epsilon-delta limit definition 1 | Limits | Differential Calculus | 

Let me draw <EQUATION> that would be interesting to take a limit of.
And I'll just draw <EQUATION> visually for now, and we'll do some specific examples a little later.
So that's my y-axis, and that's my x-axis.
And let's say the <EQUATION> looks something like I'll make it a fairly straightforward function let's say it's a line, for the most part.
Let's say it looks just like, accept it has a hole at some point.
<EQUATION>, so it's <EXPRESSION> there.
Let me black that point out so you can see that it's not defined there.
And that point there is <EQUATION>.
This is the x-axis, this is the <EQUATION> of x-axis.
Let's just say that's the y-axis.
And let's say that this is <EQUATION><EXPRESSION>, or this is <EQUATION><EXPRESSION>.
Now we've done a bunch of videos on limits.
I think you have an intuition on this.
If I were to say what is the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, and let's say that this point right here is <EXPRESSION>.
We know from our previous videos that well first of all I could write it down the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.
What this means intuitively is as we approach a from either side, as we approach it from that side, what does <EXPRESSION> approach?
So when <EXPRESSION> is here, <EQUATION> is here.
When <EXPRESSION> is here, <EQUATION> is there.
And we see that it's approaching this <EQUATION> right there.
And when we approach a from that side and we've done limits where you approach from only the left or right side, but to actually have a limit it has to approach the same thing from the positive direction and the negative direction but as you go from there, if you pick this <EXPRESSION>, then this is <EQUATION>.
<EQUATION> is right there.
If <EXPRESSION> gets here then it goes here, and as we get closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION> approaches this point <EXPRESSION>, or this value <EXPRESSION>.
So we say that the limit of <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
I think we have that intuition.
But this was not very, it's actually not rigorous at all in terms of being specific in terms of what we mean is a limit.
All I said so far is as we get closer, what does <EQUATION> get closer to?
So in this video I'll attempt to explain to you a definition of a limit that has a little bit more, or actually a lot more, mathematical rigor than just saying you know, as x gets closer to this value, what does <EQUATION> get closer to?
And the way I think about it's: kind of like a little game.
The definition is, this statement right here means that I can always give you a range about this point and when I talk about range I'm not talking about it in the whole domain range aspect, I'm just talking about a range like you know, I can give you a distance from a as long as I'm no further than that, I can guarantee you that <EQUATION> is go it not going to be any further than a given distance from <EQUATION> and the way I think about it is, it could be viewed as a little game.
Let's say you say, OK Sal, I don't believe you.
I want to see you know, whether <EQUATION> can get within <EXPRESSION>.
<EQUATION>.
So let's say you give me <EXPRESSION>.
5 and you say Sal, by this definition you should always be able to give me a range around a that will get <EQUATION> within <EXPRESSION>.
<EQUATION>, right?
So the values of <EQUATION> are always going to be right in this range, right there.
And as long as I'm in that range around a, as long as I'm the range around you give me, <EQUATION> will always be at least that close to our limit point.
Let me draw <EQUATION> a little bit bigger, just because I think I'm just overriding the same diagram over and over again.
So let's say that this is <EQUATION>, this is the hole point.
There doesn't have to be a hole there; the limit could = actually a value of the function, but the limit is more interesting when the function isn't defined there but the limit is.
So this point right here that is, let me draw the axes again.
So that's x-axis, y-axis x, y, this is the limit point <EQUATION>, this is the point <EQUATION>.
So the definition of the limit, and I'll go back to this in second because now that it's bigger I want explain it again.
It says this means and this is the epsilon delta definition of limits, and we'll touch on epsilon and delta in a second, is I can guarantee you that <EQUATION>, you give me any distance from <EQUATION> you want.
And actually let's call that epsilon.
And let's just hit on the definition right from the get go.
So you say I want to be no more than epsilon away from <EXPRESSION>.
And epsilon can just be any number greater, any real number, greater than <EXPRESSION>.
So that would be, this distance right here is epsilon.
This distance there is epsilon.
And for any epsilon you give me, any real number so this is, this would be <EXPRESSION> here, this would be <EXPRESSION> right here the epsilon delta definition of this says that no matter what epsilon one you give me, I can always specify <EXPRESSION> distance around <EXPRESSION>.
And I'll call that delta.
I can always specify <EXPRESSION> distance around <EXPRESSION>.
So let's say this is <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.
This is the letter delta.
Where as long as you pick an x that's within a plus delta and a minus delta, as long as the x is within here, I can guarantee you that the f of x, the corresponding f of x is going to be within your range.
And if you think about it this makes sense right?
It's essentially saying, I can get you as close as you want to this limit point just by and when I say as close as you want, you define what you want by giving me an epsilon; on it's a little bit of a game and I can get you as close as you want to that limit point by giving you a range around the point that <EXPRESSION> is approaching.
And as long as you pick an <EXPRESSION> value that's within this range around a, long as you pick an <EXPRESSION> value around there, I can guarantee you that <EQUATION> will be within the range you specify.
Just make this a little bit more concrete, let's say you say, I want <EXPRESSION> to be within <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> let's just you know, make everything concrete numbers.
Let's say this is the number 2 and let's say this is number 1.
So we're saying that the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> I haven't defined <EXPRESSION>, but it looks like a line with the hole right there, = 2.
This means that you can give me any number.
Let's say you want to try it out for a couple of examples.
Then I could say, OK, as long as you pick an <EXPRESSION> within I don't know, it could be arbitrarily close but as long as you pick an <EXPRESSION> that's let's say it works for this <EQUATION> that's between, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.
As long as you pick an <EXPRESSION> that's within <EXPRESSION>.
1 of this point, or 1, I can guarantee you that your f of x is going to lie in that range.
So hopefully you get a little bit of a sense of that.
Let me define that with the actual epsilon delta, and this is what you'll actually see in your mat textbook, and then we'll do a couple of examples.
And just to be clear, that was just a specific example.
You gave me one epsilon and I gave you a delta that worked.
But by definition if this is true, or if someone writes this, they're saying it doesn't just work for one specific instance, it works for any number you give me.
You can say I want to be within one millionth of, you know, or ten to the negative hundredth power of 2, you know, super close to 2, and I can always give you a range around this point where as long as you pick an x in that range, f of x will always be within this range that you specify, within that were you know, one trillionth of a unit away from the limit point.
And of course, the one thing I can't guarantee is what happens when <EQUATION>.
I'm just saying as long as you pick an <EXPRESSION> that's within my range but not on <EXPRESSION>, it'll work.
Your <EQUATION> will show up to be within the range you specify.
And just to make the math clear because I've been speaking only in words so far and this is what we see the textbook: it says look, you give me any epsilon greater than 0.
Anyway, this is a definition, right?
If someone writes this they mean that you can give them any epsilon greater than 0, and then they'll give you a delta remember your epsilon is how close you want f of x to be to your limit point, right?
It's a range around f of x they'll give you a delta which is a range around a, right?
Let me write this.
So they'll give you a delta where as long as <EXPRESSION> is no more than delta So the distance between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so if we pick an <EXPRESSION> here let me do another color if we pick an <EXPRESSION> here, the distance between that value and <EXPRESSION>, as long as one, that's greater than <EXPRESSION> so that <EXPRESSION> doesn't show up on top of <EXPRESSION>, because its function might be undefined at that point.
But as long as the distance between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION> and less than this <EXPRESSION> range that they gave you, it's less than delta.
So as long as you take an <EXPRESSION>, you know if I were to zoom the x-axis right here this is a and so this distance right here would be delta, and this distance right here would be delta as long as you pick an <EXPRESSION> value that falls here so as long as you pick that <EXPRESSION> value or this <EXPRESSION> value or this <EXPRESSION> value as long as you pick one of those x values, I can guarantee you that the distance between your function and the limit point, so the distance between you know, when you take one of these x values and you evaluate f of x at that point, that the distance between that <EQUATION> and the limit point is going to be less than the number you gave them.
And if you think of, it seems very complicated, and I have mixed feelings about where this is included in most calculus curriculums.
It's included in like the, you know, the third week before you even learn derivatives, and it's kind of this very mathy and rigorous thing to think about, and you know, it tends to derail a lot of students and a lot of people I don't think get a lot of the intuition behind it, but it is mathematically rigorous.
And I think it is very valuable once you study you know, more advanced calculus or become a math major.
But with that said, this does make a lot of sense intuitively, right?
Because before we were talking about, look you know, I can get you as close as <EXPRESSION> approaches this value <EQUATION> is going to approach this value.
And the way we mathematically define it is, you say Sal, I want to be super close.
I want the distance to be <EQUATION>.
And I want it to be <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, then I can always give you a distance around <EXPRESSION> where this will be true.
And I'm all out of time in this video.
In the next video I'll do some examples where I prove the limits, where I prove some limit statements using this definition.
And hopefully you know, when we use some tangible numbers, this definition will make a little bit more sense.
See you in the next video.
