Transcript for: Implicit Differentiation Welcome to the video on implicit differentiation.

Let's just explain the difference between implicit and explicit first.
So if I had a function that was, let's say, <EQUATION>.
In this situation, <EXPRESSION>, is defined explicitly in terms of <EXPRESSION>.
How do I know that? Well, if you give me an <EXPRESSION>, I can just input it into this expression right there, and I explicitly get <EXPRESSION>.
Right? It just pops out of the equation.
But on the other hand, what if I had something like this.
What if I define <EQUATION>.
We substitute <EQUATION>.
And that evaluates to <EXPRESSION>.
Right? If I said, define <EQUATION>.
An we substract it by <EXPRESSION>.
Then the right hand side becomes <EXPRESSION>.
So you still could solve for <EQUATION>.
And that's a different, you know, when people use the word explicit or implicit in everyday language, it's the same thing.
When you say, he explicitly said this, it means, I am hungry.
I explicitly stated that I'm hungry.
But you could implicitly state that you're hungry.
You could say, oh well, you know, I haven't eaten for a long time, and you know, boy, it would be nice to maybe eat something, and that would be kind of an implicit expression of your hunger.
Because someone would have to kind of do a little bit of work to come to the conclusion that you're hungry, instead of you telling them.
So with that out of the way, let's actually do some differentiation.
So everything you've learned about differentiation right now has been explicit differentiation.
So example.
For this function, we know how to take the explicit derivative here.
Well, it's an explicitly defined function, so we just take the derivative.
We apply the derivative operator.
We take the rate of change of both sides of this equation with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
You could do it like this.
I didn't plan to write that there that's why so it happens.
But, let's write <EXPRESSION>.
On the left side, replace it with <EXPRESSION>.
The rate of <EXPRESSION>, for every small <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION>.
That = and then, we know how to do this type of derivative.
This is just a simple quadratic.
So there.
Then, we simplify <EQUATION>.
After that, we apply implicit differentiation.
We just did some explicit differentiation.
So how do we do the same thing here? Well, we're going to do the same thing.
We're going to apply the derivative operator to both sides of this equation.
So let me do that, I'll do that in a different color.
Let me erase all of this, too, because this is kind of obvious things that you might already know.
Let me erase all of that.
OK, so I'll take the derivative operator to both sides of this equation.
So this is no different than what we did up here.
And as you learned in algebra, anything you do to one side of the equation, you have to do to the other side of the equation.
Otherwise it would no longer be an equation.
Calculate the derivative of <EQUATION>.
So we get <EXPRESSION> now this term here is where you might get a little bit confused.
I am taking the derivative of y squared with respect to x.
You know you shouldn't do this every time that you do one of these implicit differentiation problems, but I'm doing this because I want you to understand what we're doing.
So let's say I just defined <EQUATION>? 
So let's say this was <EQUATION>.
And I want to take the derivative of <EQUATION>.
So I apply the derivative operator on both sides of this, so let me do that.
We just rewrite it to <EQUATION>.
But what does the chain rule tell us? The chain rule tells us that the derivative, let me stay in the same color.
I'm always switching colors.
So you could cancel <EXPRESSION> out.
Then, we can set it to <EXPRESSION>.
So this is what the chain rule tells us.
So given that this is what the chain rule tells us, how does that help us figuring out this? 
But we already know that <EQUATION>.
I just made that definition.
That's where we started from.
Apply now the chain rule on this function.
And then, multiply by the <EXPRESSION>.
Which we don't know, and that's actually kind of what we're going to try to solve for.
Substitute <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.
So what's this derivative right here?
When you do it mechanically, it's actually quite simple.
Mechanically it's very simple, but I really want you to understand that intuition that this is coming out of the chain rule.
And actually, the chain rule itself is not this bizarre concept.
It's really, you're just multiplying fractions.
So let me clear up some space here, and we can finish this problem.
And then I'll do a problem where you have to do implicit differentiation.
And even in this one that I just gave, it's really useful to do implicit differentiation.
So let me, I could clear this guy out up here, clear that out, clear all of this stuff out, there we go.
Clear all of that out.
Ready to do some more work.
So now we can solve for <EXPRESSION> in <EQUATION>.
So we get, let's subtract <EXPRESSION> from both sides.
Then, simplify.
And replace <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.
We're just learning implicit differentiation here.
But it's sometimes it's fun to just think about things.
So how's this different from everything else we learned so far? 
Well, here we have the derivative, the derivative is actually a function of both the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> value.
And if we feel really uncomfortable having this <EXPRESSION> here, if we don't like that, what we could do, is we can substitute.
So let's solve for <EXPRESSION> here.
So you just substitute that in here.
Let's write it in another way <EXPRESSION>.
I'm just switching notation, just so you're familiar with it.
And to some degree, since we have plus or minus down here, this minus sign kind of doesn't matter, right? Because when it's a minus here it becomes a plus, when it's plus it's minuses, so you can kind of ignore this.
That's something interesting for you to think about as well.
Anyway.
And this is interesting, because our traditional way of solving derivatives, we had never seen a plus or minus here.
So that might be a little bit interesting to you.
So now let's do a problem that is actually a bit of a trick problem.
It's not a trick problem but it's actually something, that I think, I first saw it either when I was practicing for the AP Calculus exam, or actually saw it on the AP Calculus exam.
So it's something that you might encounter.
But it's really neat.
Let's say I have <EQUATION>.
So first, you say, oh, this looks easy.
Maybe I could use the power rule, but no.
You apply the chain rule.
So this is an explicit function.
I explicitly defined y in terms of x.
But it's very hard to differentiate explicitly.
And here's the trick.
But let's take the natural log on both sides of this equation.
Let's set it to <EXPRESSION>.
And why did I do that? Because now I can use what we know about logarithm properties.
We know that log of <EQUATION>.
And you can watch the exponent properties videos, if you forgot that.
So let's rewrite <EXPRESSION> using this property.
And I'm going to switch colors.
So we get the <EQUATION>.
And now we can implicitly differentiate this.
So let's take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of both sides of this equation.
And I'll switch colors again.
So the derivative of this expression with respect to <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.
Now, we apply the chain rule.
Well, now we can just use the product rule.
Let me clear that out up there.
I'm already over time, but I've become a YouTube partner, so my videos can be longer.
But I don't want to make them too long, because you'll get bored.
All right.
So let's simplify this.
I'm just multiplying both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>.
So let's substitute <EQUATION>.
But that's pretty neat.
This is kind of a, you know, a five-star problem that you might see in your books, and you might see it in a math competition, and people will be really impressed.
Anyway, I've talked for too long.
I will see you in the next video.
