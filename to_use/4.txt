Transcript for: Limit examples (part 2) | Limits | Differential Calculus | 

OK, hopefully, my tool is working now.
But anyway, so we were saying when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, so we're getting closer and closer to <EXPRESSION> from the negative side, <EXPRESSION> = minus <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, right?
You can just evaluate <EQUATION> yourself, right?
And as you see, as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the negative direction, we get larger and larger or I guess you could say smaller and smaller negative numbers, right?
You get you know, if it's <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, you'd get minus <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>, you could imagine the closer and closer you get to <EXPRESSION>.
Similarly, when you go from the other direction, when you say what is when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, there you get <EXPRESSION>, right?
When <EXPRESSION> is point the thing is frozen again when it's <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>, you get positive <EXPRESSION>.
So as you see, as you approach <EXPRESSION> from the negative direction, you get larger and larger negative values, or I guess smaller and smaller negative values.
And as you go from the positive direction, you get larger and larger values.
Let me graph <EQUATION> just to give you a sense of what this graph looks like because this is actually a good graph to know what it looks like just generally.
So when <EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> gets really, really, really negative, as <EXPRESSION> is like <EXPRESSION>, this is approaching <EXPRESSION>, but it's still going to be a slightly negative number.
And then as we see from what we drew, as we approach <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, we asymptote, and we approach <EXPRESSION>, right?
And similarly, from positive numbers, if you go out to the right really far, it approaches <EXPRESSION>, but it's still going to be positive.
And as we gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, it spikes up, and it goes to <EXPRESSION>.
You never quite get <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
So in this situation, you actually have as <EXPRESSION> approaches so let me give you a different notation, which you'll probably see eventually.
I might actually do a separate presentation on this.
The limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive direction, that's this notation here, of <EXPRESSION>, right?
So this is as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive direction, from the right-hand side, well, this = <EXPRESSION>.
And then the limit as <EXPRESSION> this pen, this pen the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the negative side of <EXPRESSION>.
This notation just says the limit as I approach from the negative side.
So as I approach <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> from this direction, right, from this direction, what happens?
Well, that = <EXPRESSION>.
So since I'm approaching a different value when I approach from one side or the other, this limit is actually undefined.
I mean, we could say that from the positive side, it's positive infinity, or from the negative side, it's negative infinity, but they have to = the same thing for this limit to be defined.
So <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
So let's do another problem, and I think this should be interesting now.
So let's say, just keeping that last problem we had in mind, what's the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>?
So in this situation, I'll draw the graph <EQUATION>.
That's my x-axis.
That's my y-axis.
So here, no matter what value we put into x, we get a positive value, right?
Because you're going to square <EXPRESSION>.
If you put minus you could actually oh, let me do it.
It'll be instructive, I think.
Once again, obviously you can't just put <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
You'll get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.
But let's say <EXPRESSION>.
What does <EXPRESSION> evaluate to?
<EXPRESSION> squared is <EXPRESSION>.
So regardless of whether we put a negative or positive number here, we get a positive value.
And similarly, if I put if we say <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
If you evaluate <EXPRESSION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, and if we put <EXPRESSION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, right?
Because we square <EQUATION>.
So in this graph, if you were to draw <EQUATION>, and if you have a graphing calculator, you should experiment, it looks something like this.
I can see this dark blue.
So from the negative side, it approaches <EXPRESSION>, right?
You can see that.
As we get to smaller and smaller as we get closer and closer to 0 from the negative side, it approaches infinity.
As we go from the positive side these are actually symmetric, although I didn't draw <EQUATION> that symmetric it also approaches <EXPRESSION>.
So this is a case in which the limit oh, that's not too bright.
I don't know if you can see the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the negative side of <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, and the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive side of <EXPRESSION> is also = <EXPRESSION>.
So when you go from the left-hand side, <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, right?
It goes to <EXPRESSION> as you approach <EXPRESSION>.
And as you go from the right-hand side, it also goes to <EXPRESSION>.
And so the limit in general = <EXPRESSION>.
And this is why I got excited when I first started learning limits.
Because for the first time, <EXPRESSION> is a legitimate answer to your problem, which, I don't know, on some metaphysical level got me kind of excited.
But anyway, I will do more problems in the next presentation because you can never do enough limit problems.
And in a couple of presentations, I actually give you the formal, kind of rigorous mathematical definition of the limits.
