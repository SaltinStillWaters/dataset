Transcript for: More limits | Limits | Differential Calculus | 

I've been asked to do some more limit problems.
So let's do some more.
So let's see.
What's the first problem I have?
It says the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Now what immediately confuses most people is this absolute value thing.
Because how do you deal with it?
Because you can't just subtract.
If <EXPRESSION> was an <EXPRESSION>, it would be a simple problem.
Because then you could just simplify it.
You could subtract <EXPRESSION> from this <EXPRESSION> and then divide by <x>.
And you'd get an answer.
But this has an absolute value, so you can't just directly manipulate it.
Well what if we're able to get rid of this absolute value?
How do we do that?
Well, in order for this limit to exist in order for this limit I don't know.
Let's say <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, right?
And <EXPRESSION> is what we have to solve for.
In order for that limit to exist, then the limit to <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> also has to exist from the positive and the negative sides.
What do I mean?
Well that means that this must also be true.
The limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the right-hand side, from positive numbers, of <EXPRESSION> has to be = <EXPRESSION>.
And then we also know that the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, is also going to be = <EXPRESSION>, right?
If this If we approach <EXPRESSION> from the left, we get some number.
And as we approach <EXPRESSION> from the right, we get the same number, then we know that no matter what direction we approach 0 from, which is this situation, we approach that number.
So let's figure out these two limits.
And if they have the same answer, then we have the answer to our original problem.
So how can we simplify <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive side?
Well that's the same thing as the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive side.
Well if we know we're approaching <EXPRESSION> from the positive side, what do we know about <EXPRESSION>?
We know that <EXPRESSION> is positive, right?
It's approaching from the right.
So if <EXPRESSION> is positive, we can get rid of these absolute value signs.
So we just get <EXPRESSION>.
And so that = the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive side.
Let's see.
That's <EXPRESSION>.
This is <EXPRESSION>, right?
<EXPRESSION>.
And then <EXPRESSION>.
So the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive side of <EXPRESSION>.
Well that's just going to = <EXPRESSION>.
OK.
Now let's take this case down here when we're approaching from the negative side.
So how can we think about this?
What is the absolute value of <EXPRESSION> if <EXPRESSION> is a negative number?
Well the absolute value of <EXPRESSION>, if <EXPRESSION> is a negative number, is going to be the negative of <EXPRESSION>, right?
If <EXPRESSION> Think of it this way: if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, when we take the absolute value of x, we're essentially just multiplying x times <EXPRESSION> again.
So another way to rewrite this is: this = the limit as x approaches 0 from the negative side of <EXPRESSION> what?
The absolute value of <EXPRESSION> is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.
Hopefully that makes sense to you, right?
If we're dealing with negative numbers, then taking the absolute value of a negative number is the same thing as multiplying that negative number times the negative to essentially make it into a positive number, right?
And then, of course, the absolute value of <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, since we're dealing with a negative number, is also = <EXPRESSION>.
And let's see if we can simplify <EQUATION>.
So that means that the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the negative side Let's see.
I get <EXPRESSION>.
Cancel out <EXPRESSION>.
So I get <EXPRESSION>, right?
So I get <EXPRESSION>.
That = <EXPRESSION>.
So this is interesting.
I am approaching a different number when I approach it from the left-hand side.
When I approached this function from the left-hand side or from the right-hand side.
So it looks like this limit doesn't exist.
Let's confirm that.
Let me actually Let me see if I can Let me get the graphing calculator and confirm.
Let me type it in.
So <EXPRESSION>.
And what am I <EXPRESSION> Divided by the <EXPRESSION>.
Let's see.
Graph <EQUATION>.
And what does it have here?
Zoom out.
So this is Is this right?
<EXPRESSION>
Graph <EQUATION>.
There you go.
Even the oh.
I don't think you can see it yet.
the graphing calculator confirms the work we did.
Although it connects them and it makes you think the it somehow approaches here.
But that's just because it picks points and just plots them.
So as you see, as you approach from the right-hand side, you approach <EXPRESSION>, right?
Well actually you're at <EXPRESSION> the whole time on the right-hand side.
And as you approach from the left-hand side, you approach <EXPRESSION>.
So the limit does not exist at <EQUATION>.
You would say <EQUATION>.
You know, there's a little dirty secret about limits.
It's not a dirty secret, but in theory you should never get a limit problem wrong.
And why?
Well you should be able to solve it analytically.
But if you don't know how to solve it analytically, just put it really really small numbers here.
Try out If you put in Try <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
Try numbers that are just slightly larger then whatever your limit number is.
And then slightly smaller.
And then, just numerically, if you have a calculator, see what it's approaching.
And sometimes you don't even need a calculator.
You could probably calculate this in your head with <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> or something like that.
Anyway, let's do another problem.
Invert colors.
OK.
So let's do the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Now this looks a lot like <EXPRESSION>.
And we know <EXPRESSION>.
What is that?
And if you don't believe me, watch the videos where we prove it using the squeeze theorem.
We proved that the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Now this looks almost like that.
It would be great if we could get it into that form and then we'd be done.
So how can we do that?
Well let's try to substitute.
Let's try to get a single variable here instead of a <EXPRESSION> times a variable.
So let's make a substitution in magenta.
Substitue <EQUATION>
And then that also means that So divide both sides by <EXPRESSION> and we get <EQUATION>.
So let's make that substitution and do this.
So this The limit as <EQUATION> approaches <EQUATION> would be the same thing as what?
If approaches As <EQUATION> approaches <EQUATION> here, <EQUATION> is also going to approach 0, right?
So this is the same thing as the limit as a approaches <EXPRESSION>.
Or you could view it this way: as a approaches <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is still approaching <EXPRESSION>.
Maybe at 1/5 the pace, but it's the same thing.
Anyway, this should say the limit is a approaches <EXPRESSION>, right?
And hopefully you're satisfied that the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> is the same That <EXPRESSION> is still approaching <EXPRESSION>, right?
Because if <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> here, that's going to make <EXPRESSION> approach <EXPRESSION>.
So it's the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
But <EQUATION>.
So it's <EXPRESSION>.
And so that = the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Well that's the same thing.
We could take this out.
We could take this <EXPRESSION> right, it's in the denominator out.
This is just a constant term, so we can take it out of the limit.
And obviously if we're taking it out of the denominator, it flips, right?
Because this is just <EXPRESSION>.
So the right hand side = <EXPRESSION> right, I just took this out of the denominator and it flips, right, because it's <EXPRESSION> times the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
And now that looks an awful lot like this.
It's just we have an <EXPRESSION> instead of an <EXPRESSION>, but that doesn't make a difference.
So this = <EXPRESSION>.
So this whole thing, since this = <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.
And, once again, if you get this answer and you're not so sure, take your calculator out and try calculate.
What is the <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>?
So <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
If you take that, you're going to get a number that's awfully close to this number.
This is approximate.
This is exactly <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION>.
You're probably going to get like <EXPRESSION>.
<EXPRESSION> or something like that.
So let's do another one.
OK.
So I have the limit as <EXPRESSION><EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION><EXPRESSION> this one looks a lot like the previous one, although we have some exponents here of <EXPRESSION><EXPRESSION>.
And that almost looks like <EXPRESSION><EXPRESSION>, but I have these squared terms.
What can I do?
Well this is the same thing.
This is <EXPRESSION>.
So this is the same thing as the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, right?
If you were to take this out, you'd square the numerator, square the denominator, and you'd get this.
If you took If you wanted to change this.
I won't say simplify.
Well now this is interesting.
Well this <EXPRESSION> is This is a constant term.
This isn't going to change with the limit.
So essentially, we can say, well this is going to be = the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, the whole thing squared.
And how is that?
I couldn't have done this if there was an <EXPRESSION> here, right, because that would have changed the limit.
But this is a constant term.
So this The base is the only thing that's going to change as I take as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.
So I can take the limit within the base, I guess you could say, and get here.
And now we're back to what we proved in a previous video.
What is the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>?
Right.
It's <EXPRESSION>.
So what's <EXPRESSION> squared?
It is <EXPRESSION>.
There you go.
And I've taken 13 minutes of your time.
Hopefully you've found it vaguely Useful.
