Transcript for: Product rule | Taking derivatives | Differential Calculus | 

Welcome back.
I'm now going to introduce you to a new tool for solving derivatives.
Really between this rule, which is the product rule, and the chain rule and just knowing a lot of function derivatives, you'll be ready to tackle almost any derivative problem.
Let's start with the chain rule.
Let's say that <EQUATION>.
This is the product rule.
In the chain rule it was <EQUATION>.
Right? I don't know if you remember that.
In this case, <EQUATION>.
Pretty straightforward.
Let's apply the chain rule to <EQUATION>.
Let's say that <EQUATION>.
So one way we could have done it, we could just multiply <EXPRESSION> out.
Let's use the product rule on <EXPRESSION>.
Let me take the derivative of the <EXPRESSION>.
The derivative of that is pretty straightforward.
<EQUATION>.
We're just going to multiply it times this <EXPRESSION>, doing nothing different to it.
Maybe I'll just do it in a different color.
<EXPRESSION>.
And then to that we will add the derivative of this <EXPRESSION>.
So, set that = <EXPRESSION>.
And multiply that times <EXPRESSION>.
I guess I'll switch back to mauve, I think you get the point.
All we did here was we said OK, <EXPRESSION> is made of these <EXPRESSION> and they are multiplied by each other.
If I want to take the derivative of it, I take the derivative of the first one and multiply it by the second one.
And then I add <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> and multiply it by the <EXPRESSION>.
Let's do some more examples and I think that will hit the point home.
Clear image.
Change the colors and I'm back in business.
Let me think of a good problem.
Let me do another one like this, and then I'll actually introduce ones and the product rule and the chain rule.
So let's say that <EQUATION>.
Then we say <EQUATION>.
And I just multiply it times this expression <EXPRESSION>, right?
And I add <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.
Then set the result to <EXPRESSION>.
And you could simplify <EXPRESSION>.
We could also factor out <EXPRESSION>.
But that's really just algebra.
Now, we apply the product rule.
I'm going to do one more example where I'll show you, I'm going to use the product and the chain rule and I think this will optimally confuse you.
I want to make sure I have some space.
Here I'm going to use a slightly different notation.
So we take the derivative of the inside which is <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION>.
So there we take the derivative of this <EXPRESSION> right here.
And then the product rules says we take the derivative of the <EXPRESSION>.
So set the <EXPRESSION> to just <EXPRESSION>.
We're going to use the chain rule again on <EQUATION>.
So we take the derivative of the inside <EXPRESSION>
And now we take the derivative of the whole thing.
And then we multiply this <EXPRESSION> times the first term.
So this is a really, I mean you might want to simplify at this point.
But I think this gives you the idea.
But using the chain rule, you're actually able to, even though we ended up with a pretty complicated answer, we got the right answer.
And now we could actually evaluate the slope of this very complicated function at any point just by substituting the point into this fairly complicated expression.
But at least we could do it.
I think you're going to find that the chain and the product rules become even more useful once we start doing derivatives of expressions other than polynomials.
I'm going to teach you about trigonometric functions and natural log and logarithm and exponential functions.
Actually, I'll probably do that in the next presentation.
So I will see you soon.
