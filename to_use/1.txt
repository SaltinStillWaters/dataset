Transcript for: Introduction to limits | Limits | Differential Calculus | Khan Academy 

In this video, I want to familiarize you with the idea of a limit, which is a super important idea.
It's really the idea that all of calculus is based upon.
But despite being so super important, it's actually a really simple idea.
So let me draw a <EQUATION> here, actually, let me define a <EQUATION> here, a kind of a simple function.
So let's say that <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.
And you might say, hey, Sal look, I have the same thing in the numerator and denominator.
Can't I just simplify <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>? And I would say, well, you're almost true, the difference between <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> and this thing right over here, is that this thing can never = this thing is <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
So you can make the simplification.
Now this and this are equivalent, both of these are going to be = 1 for all other X's other than one, but at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, it becomes <EXPRESSION>.
This is <EXPRESSION> and this one's <EXPRESSION>.
So how would I graph this function.
So let me graph it.
So that, is my <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>
And then let's say this is the point <EQUATION>.
This over here would be <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.
This is <EQUATION>, right up there I could do <EXPRESSION>.
but that matter much relative to this function right over here.
And let me graph the <EQUATION>.
So let me write it again.
It's kind of redundant, but I'll rewrite it f of 1 is undefined.
But what if I were to ask you, what is the <EQUATION> approaching as <EQUATION>.
And now this is starting to touch on the idea of a limit.
So as x gets closer and closer to 1.
So as we get closer and closer x is to 1, what is the function approaching.
Well, this entire time, the function, what's a getting closer and closer to.
On the left hand side, no matter how close you get to <EXPRESSION>, as long as you're not at <EXPRESSION>1, you're actually at <EQUATION>.
Over here from the right hand side, you get the same thing.
So you could say, and we'll get more and more familiar with this idea as we do more examples, that the limit as x and L-I-M, short for limit, as x approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, as we get closer, we can get infinitely close to <EXPRESSION>, as long as we're not at <EXPRESSION>.
And our <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>
So in this case, we could say the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.
So once again, it has very fancy notation, but it's just saying, look what is a function approaching as x gets closer and closer to 1.
Let me do another example where we're dealing with a curve, just so that you have the general idea.
Let's say that we have <EXPRESSION>, we could define it as <EXPRESSION>
So once again, a kind of an interesting function that, as you'll see, is not fully continuous, it has a discontinuity.
Let me graph <EQUATION>.
So this is my y = f of x axis, this is my x-axis right over here.
Let me draw x = 2, x, let's say this is x = 1, this is x = 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2.
And then let me draw <EQUATION>
So let me draw <EQUATION> like this.
So it's going to be a parabola, looks something like this, let me draw a better version of the parabola.
So it'll look something like this.
Not the most beautifully drawn parabola in the history of drawing parabolas, but I think it'll give you the idea.
I think you know what a parabola looks like, hopefully.
It should be symmetric, let me redraw it because that's kind of ugly.
And that's looking better.
OK, all right, there you go.
All right, now, this would be the graph of just <EQUATION>.
But this can't be.
When x = 2, so let's say that, and I'm not doing them on the same scale, but let's say that.
So this, on the graph of f of x = x squared, this would be 4, this would be 2, this would be 1, this would be 3.
So when x = 2, our function = 1.
So this is a bit of a bizarre function, but we can define it this way.
You can define a <EXPRESSION> however you like to define it.
And so notice, graph <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>
So then then at 2, just at 2, just exactly at 2, it drops down to 1.
And then it keeps going along the function g of x =, or I should say, along the function x squared.
So my question to you.
So there's a couple of things, if I were to just evaluate the <EXPRESSION>.
What is the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.
Once again, fancy notation, but it's asking something pretty, pretty, pretty simple.
It's saying as x gets closer and closer to 2, as you get closer and closer, and this isn't a rigorous definition, we'll do that in future videos.
As x gets closer and closer to 2, what is g of x approaching? So if you get to 1.
9, and then 1.
999, and then 1.
999999, and then 1.
9999999, what is g of x approaching.
Or if you were to go from the positive direction.
If you were to say 2.
1, what's g of 2.
1, what's g of 2.
01, what's g of 2.
001, what is that approaching as we get closer and closer to it.
And you can see it visually just by drawing the graph.
As g gets closer and closer to 2, and if we were to follow along the graph, we see that we are approaching 4.
Even though that's not where the function is, the function drops down to 1.
The limit of g of x as x approaches 2 = 4.
And you could even do this numerically using a calculator, and let me do that, because I think that will be interesting.
So let me get the calculator out, let me get my trusty TI-85 out.
So here is my calculator, and you could numerically say, OK, what's it going to approach as you approach x = 2.
So let's try 1.
94, for x = 1.
9, you would use this top clause right over here.
So you'd have 1.
9 squared.
And so you get 3.
61, well what if you get even closer to 2, so 1.
99, and once again, let me square that.
Well now I'm at 3.
96.
What if I do 1.
999, and I square that? I'm going to have 3.
996.
Notice I'm going closer, and closer, and closer to our point.
And if I did, if I got really close, 1.
9999999999 squared, what am I going to get to.
It's not actually going to be exactly 4, this calculator just rounded things up, but going to get to a number really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really close to 4.
And we can do something from the positive direction too.
And it actually has to be the same number when we approach from the below what we're trying to approach, and above what we're trying to approach.
So if we try to 2.
1 squared, we get 4.
4.
If we do 2.
let me go a couple of steps ahead, 2.
01, so this is much closer to 2 now, squared.
Now we are getting much closer to 4.
So the closer we get to 2, the closer it seems like we're getting to 4.
So once again, that's a numeric way of saying that the limit, as x approaches 2 from either direction of g of x, even though right at 2, the function = 1, because it's discontinuous.
The limit as we're approaching 2, we're getting closer, and closer, and closer to 4.
