Transcript for: Introduction to limits | Limits | Differential Calculus | Khan AcademyIn this video, I wantto familiarize you with the idea of a limit, whichis a super important idea.

 It's really the idea that allof calculus is based upon.
 But despite beingso super important, it's actually a really simple idea.
 So let me draw afunction here, actually, let me define a function here, a kind of a simple function.
 So let's define <EQUATION>.
 And you might say, hey, Sal look, I have the same thing in the numerator and denominator.
 If I have something divided by itself, that would just be equal to <EXPRESSION>.
 Can't I just simplify this to <EQUATION>? And I would say, well, you're almost true, the difference between <EQUATION> and this thing right over here, is that this thing can never equal this thing is undefined when <EQUATION>.
 Because if you set, let me define it.
 Let me write it over here, if you have <EQUATION>, what happens.
 In the numerator, we get <EXPRESSION>, which is, let me just write it down, in the numerator, you get <EXPRESSION>.
 And in the denominator, you get <EXPRESSION>, which is also <EXPRESSION>.
 And so anything divided by <EXPRESSION>, including <EXPRESSION>, this is undefined.
 So you can makethe simplification.
 You can say that this is you thesame thing as let <EQUATION>, but you would have to add the constraint that x cannot be equal to <EXPRESSION>.
 So how would Igraph this <EQUATION>.
 So let me graph <EQUATION>.
 So that, is let <EQUATION>.
And let me graph <EQUATION>.
 So it's essentially for any x other than 1 let <EQUATION>.
 We don't know what this function equals at 1.
 We never defined it.
 This definition of thefunction doesn't tell us what to do with 1.
 It's literally undefined, literally undefined when x is equal to 1.
 So this is the functionright over here.
 And so once again, if someonewere to ask you what is f of 1, you go, and let's say thateven though this was a function definition, you'd go, OK x is equal to 1, oh wait there's a gap inmy function over here.
 It is undefined.
 So let me write it again.
 It's kind of redundant, but I'llrewrite it <EQUATION>.
 But what if I wereto ask you, what is the functionapproaching as x equals 1.
 And now this is starting totouch on the idea of a limit.
 So as x gets closerand closer to 1.
 So as we get closerand closer x is to 1, what is thefunction approaching.
 Well, this entiretime, the function, what's a gettingcloser and closer to.
 On the left hand side, no matter how close you get to 1, as long as you're not at 1, you're actually at <EQUATION>.
 Over here from the right handside, you get the same thing.
 So you could say, and we'll get more and more familiar with this idea as we do more examples, that the limit as x and L-I-M, short for limit, as x approaches 1 of f of xis equal to, as we get closer, we can get unbelievably, we can get infinitely close to 1, as long as we're not at 1.
 And our function is going to be equal to 1, it's getting closer and closer and closer to 1.
 It's actually at 1 the entire time.
 So in this case, we could say the limit as x approaches 1 of f of x is 1.
 So once again, it has very fancy notation, but it's just saying, look what is afunction approaching as x gets closerand closer to 1.
 Let me do another example where we're dealing with a curve, just so that you have the general idea.
 So let's say that I have the function g of x, we could define it as <EXPRESSION>.
 So once again, a kind of an interesting function that, as you'll see, is not fully continuous, it has a discontinuity.
 Let me graph <EQUATION>.
 Let me draw <EQUATION>, So it'll look something like this.
 Not the most beautifully drawn parabola in the history of drawing parabolas, but I think it'll give you the idea.
 I think you know what a parabola looks like, hopefully.
 It should be symmetric, let me redraw it because that's kind of ugly.
 And that's looking better.
 OK, all right, there you go.
 All right, now, this would be the graph of just x squared.
 But this can't be.
 It's not x squared when x is equal to 2.
 So once again, when x is equal to 2, we should have a little bit of a discontinuity here.
 So I'll draw a gap right over there, because when x equals 2 the function is equal to 1.
 When x is equal to2, so let's say that, and I'm not doing them on the same scale, but let's say that.
 So this, on the graph of fof x is equal to x squared, this would be 4, this would be 2, this would be 1, this would be 3.
 So when x is equal to 2, our function is equal to 1.
 So this is a bit ofa bizarre function, but we can define it this way.
 You can define a function however you like to define it.
 And so notice, it's just like the graph <EQUATION>, except when you get to 2, it has this gap, because you don't use the <EQUATION>.
 So my question to you.
 So there's a couple of things, if I were to just evaluate the <EQUATION>.
 Or perhaps a moreinteresting question.
 Solve limit as x approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EQUATION>.
 Once again, fancy notation, but it's asking something pretty, pretty, pretty simple.
 As x gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, what is <EQUATION> approaching? So if you get to 1.
 And you can see it visually just by drawing the graph of <EQUATION>.
 As g gets closer and closer to 2, and if we were to follow along the graph, we see that we are approaching 4.
 Even though that's not where the function is, the function drops down to 1.
 Solve the limit of <EQUATION> as x approaches <EXPRESSION>.
