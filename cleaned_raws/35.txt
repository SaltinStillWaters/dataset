Transcript for: Trig Implicit Differentiation Example 

I've been asked implicitly differentiate the equation <EQUATION>.
And I've done several implicit differentiation videos, but this tends to be one of the biggest sources of pain for first year calculus students.
So I thought I would give at least another example.
It never hurts to see as many as possible.
So let's do this one.
So to implicitly differentiate this, we just apply the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> operator to both sides of the equation.
The derivative with this respect to <EXPRESSION> the derivative of the left side with respect to <EXPRESSION> is the same as the derivative of the right side with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
The right side's going to be very straightforward, but the left side is a little bit tricky.
So let's do that on the side over here.
Let me write the left hand side a little bit differently with <EXPRESSION>.
I'm going to do it in a different color.
Let me say that <EQUATION>.
And let me say that <EQUATION>.
Then <EXPRESSION> is clearly the same thing.
Rewrite <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.
So if we're taking the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, that's what we want to do right here.
Let me just take the derivative of both sides of this.
This would be the <EXPRESSION>.
Well that's pretty straightforward, we just equate it to <EXPRESSION>.
Then we add <EXPRESSION>.
So let me write <EXPRESSION> like this.
I'll write the <EXPRESSION>.
We just apply the derivative operator to <EXPRESSION>, and we don't know what this thing is, we're going to solve for it.
But obviously, I can't just leave this here, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.
The reason why I wrote it this way is because I wanted to show you that when you take the derivative of this, it just comes out of the chain rule.
It's not some type of new voodoo magic that you haven't learned yet.
So the derivative let me just write down the <EXPRESSION>.
Then apply the chain rule.
That's just the chain rule and it's very easy to remember>
Because we cancel out <EXPRESSION>.
So what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? 
Well, that's just <EXPRESSION>.
And if you don't have that memorized, it's actually not too hard to prove to yourself if you just write this as <EXPRESSION>, but this tends to be one of the trig derivatives that most people memorize.
I think I've already made a video where I proved this.
And some books still write this as <EXPRESSION>, but we know that <EXPRESSION> is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.
I like to keep it in kind of the fundamental trig functions, or trig ratios as opposed to things like <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.
Then what's the derivative of b with respect to x? So this is pretty interesting.
Let me re-write <EQUATION>, actually to <EQUATION>.
So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, we could do a little bit of chain rule right here.
So, let's apply the chain rule.
We could say let me write this <EQUATION>.
So the <EQUATION>.
So this thing right here, and clearly I haven't completely simplified it yet.
Then, we simplify.
I still have to figure out what this thing is here.
But I just simply applied the product rule here.
Your derivative of the <EXPRESSION> term, derivative of <EXPRESSION>.
That's all I did there.
So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just this thing right there.
So it = let me do it in the yellow so it's times oh, I'll do it in the blue since I already wrote it.
So let me write <EQUATION> down here.
So we just figured out, or we're almost done figuring out, what the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is, and we could throw that in there.
But we're not done.
I know this might seem a little bit cumbersome what I'm doing here, but I think it might make a little bit of sense.
Let me just set <EQUATION>.
That's what this thing is.
This thing is that right there.
That's what we're trying to solve for.
That just comes out of the chain rule.
So this thing right here, this is the derivative of this thing with respect to x, which is the same thing as derivative of c with respect to x.
So I can write <EXPRESSION> right here, I can re-write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.
So now we've simplified this a good bit.
I hope going into the chain rule didn't confuse you, because I really want to hit the point home that all of these implicit differentiation problems, these dy dx's just don't, it's not some rule that you should memorize.
They come out naturally from the chain rule.
Let me write it, it's = <EXPRESSION>.
Then that = the right hand side.
And now all we have to do is solve for dy dx.
So let me just review how we got here.
I went through the chain rule at every step of the way, but once you get the hang of it, you can literally just go straight down this way.
The way you think about it is the right hand side I think you get it.
So it's <EXPRESSION>, and you multiply that times <EXPRESSION>.
That's why it was good to do over to the side so we don't make a careless mistake.
But once you get used to it you could actually do that in your head, and of course, set <EXPRESSION> = the right hand side.
So from here on out it's just pure algebra.
Just to solve for our <EXPRESSION>.
So a good place to start is to multiply both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>.
So obviously, that'll turn to <EXPRESSION> on the right side.
And the left hand side will be <EXPRESSION> times this denominator.
Now what can we do.
We can subtract this <EXPRESSION> from both sides of the equation, and we get <EXPRESSION>.
All I did is I subtracted this from both sides of the equation, so essentially I moved it over to the left hand side.
What I'm trying to do is I'm going to try to separate the non dy dx terms from the dy dx terms.
So I want to bring this <EXPRESSION> term over to the right hand side.
So let me add <EXPRESSION> to both sides.
So then set that = <EXPRESSION>.
I think we're in the home stretch.
Let's factor this <EXPRESSION> out from the right hand side.
So set this = <EXPRESSION>.
And that = this thing over here, it's = <EXPRESSION>.
Now to solve for <EXPRESSION>, we just have to divide both sides of this equation by this expression right here.
And then what do we get? We get, if we just divide both sides by that, we get <EXPRESSION>.
And then we're done.
The hard part really is getting to this step right here.
After this step it's literally just pure algebra just to solve for the <EXPRESSION>, and then you get that answer right there.
Anyway, hopefully you found that useful.
