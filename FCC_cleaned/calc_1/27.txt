Proof that Differentiable Functions are Continuous.
differentiable functions are continuous.
What we want to show here is that if a function is differentiable at a number x equals a, then it's continuous at x equals a.
Let me call the function f of x.
And I'm going to start out by writing down what it means for f of x to be differentiable at x equals a.
That means that the limit as x goes to a of f of x minus F of A over x minus a exists and equals this finite number that we call f prime However, if all we know is that f is continuous at x equals a, then we can't conclude anything about whether or not is differentiable there, f may or may not be differentiable at x equals a.
Remember the square root example, the square root of x is continuous at x equals zero, but it's not differentiable there because of the corner.
In this video, we related the graph of a function to the graph of its derivative.
By thinking about the slopes of tangent lines, we also looked at several ways that a derivative can fail to exist at a point and noted that if a function is differentiable, it has to be continuous.
This video gives a proof that differentiable functions are continuous.

Now I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation of a.
Now I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by the limit as x goes to a of x minus a.
Now wait a second, before I go any further on to make sure this is legit.
Does this limit actually exist?
Well, yeah, because the limit as x goes to a of x exists, that's just a, and the limit as x goes to a of a exists, that's a also.
So the limit of the difference has to exist.
And actually, that limit of the difference is the difference of the limits, which is just going to be a minus a or a zero.
So I've actually just multiplied both sides by zero and a fancy form.

This is actually a surprisingly useful thing to do.
Because I have a product of a limit of two limits here, both of which exist.
So by the product rule for limits, I can rewrite this as the limit as x goes to a This is actually a surprisingly useful thing to do.

So by the product rule for limits, I can rewrite this as the limit as x goes to a of x minus a times f of x minus F of A over x minus a.
And canceling these two copies of x minus a, which is fine to do when x is near a, just not when x equals a, I get that the limit of f of x minus f of a is equal to this limit over here.
Well, we said this limit was just zero.
So my limit on the left is equal to zero.
of x minus a times f of x minus F of A over x minus a.
