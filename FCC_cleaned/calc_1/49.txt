The Chain Rule.
everywhere we see an x in this formula, so that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus x squared plus x.
Once again, I can simplify by distributing out, that gives me x to the fourth plus 2x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x, or x to the fourth plus 2x cubed plus 2x squared plus x.
In this last set of examples, we're asked to go backwards, we're given a formula for a function of h of x.
But we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions, F and G.
Let's think for a minute, which of these two functions gets applied first, f composed with g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x.
And since we evaluate these expressions from the inside out, we must be applying g first, and then F.
In order to figure out what what f and g could be, I like to draw a box around some thing inside my expression for H, so I'm going to draw a box around x squared plus seven, then whatever's inside the box, that'll be my function, g of x, the first function that gets applied, whatever happens to the box, in this case, taking the square root sign, that becomes my outside function, my second function f.
So here, we're gonna say g of x is equal to x squared plus seven, and f of x is equal to the square root of x, let's just check and make sure that this works.
So I need to check that when I take the composition, f composed with g, I need to get the same thing as my original h.
So let's see, if I do f composed with g of x, well, by definition, that's f of g of x.

So I need to check that when I take the composition, f composed with g, I need to get the same thing as my original h.
So let's see, if I do f composed with g of x, well, by definition, that's f of g of x.
Working from the inside out, I can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven.
So I need to evaluate f of x squared plus seven.
That means I plug in x squared plus seven, into the formula for for F.
So that becomes the square root of x squared plus seven, two, it works because it matches my original equation.
So we found a correct answer a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions.
But I do want to point out, this is not the only correct answer.
I'll write down my formula for H of X again, and this time, I'll put the box in a different place, I'll just box the x squared.
If I did that, then my inside function, my first function, g of x would be x squared.
And my second function is what happens Working from the inside out, I can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven.
So I need to evaluate f of x squared plus seven.
That means I plug in x squared plus seven, into the formula for for F.
So that becomes the square root of x squared plus seven, two, it works because it matches my original equation.

If I did that, then my inside function, my first function, g of x would be x squared.
And my second function is what happens to the box.
to the box.
So my f of x is what happens to the box, and the box gets added seven to it, and taking the square root.
So in other words, f of x is going to be the square root of x plus seven.
Again, I can check that this works.
If I do f composed with g of x, that's f So my f of x is what happens to the box, and the box gets added seven to it, and taking the square root.
So in other words, f of x is going to be the square root of x plus seven.
Again, I can check that this works.
If I do f composed with g of x, that's f of g of x.
of g of x.
So now g of x is x squared, so I'm taking f of x squared.
When I plug in x squared for x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven.
So this is an alternative correct solution.
In this video, we learn to evaluate the composition of functions.
by rewriting it and working from the inside out.
We also learn to break apart a complicated function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function and letting the first function applied in the composition.
Let that be the inside of the box and the second function applied in the composition be whatever happens to the box.
So now g of x is x squared, so I'm taking f of x squared.
When I plug in x squared for x, I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven.
So this is an alternative correct solution.
