[Corequisite] Log Functions and Their Graphs.
Because intuitively, this is saying that sine theta is approximately equal to theta itself when theta is near zero, because the ratio is approximately one.
So if I want to approximate sine of this value of theta, without a calculator, I can use that fact.
And say that the sine of 0.
01769 is going to be approximately equal to 0.
01769.
This is an important time to remind you that when we're doing these limits, we're assuming that theta is in radians.
If it's not in radians, we won't get this nice limit of one here.
So that's our approximation.
And we can check it on a calculator, and I actually get an exact value of this number up to 10 decimal places.
So as you can see, this is a really good approximation.
We can use this same limit fat, again, in the next example, to calculate this complicated limit as x goes to zero, the limit of tan of 7x over sine of forex.
So when I see tangents and signs and expression, I'm always tempted to rewrite things.
And just in terms of sine and cosine, so I'm going to do that first I'm going to rewrite tangent as as sine over cosine.
That still divided by sine of forex, and now I'm going to flip and multiply to get sine of 7x over cosine of 7x times one over sine of 4x.
Now intuitively, if x is near zero, therefore 7x and 4x are also near zero, then sine of 7x is approximately equal to 7x.
And sine of 4x is approximately equal to 4x.
So intuitively, this limit should be pretty much the same thing as the limit as x goes to zero of 7x over cosine 7x times 4x.
And canceling the access, this is just the same as seven fourths times the limit of one of our cosine 7x.
Since cosine of 7x is going to one, this should just be seven fourths.
So this is the intuitive approach, let me also give you a more rigorous approach.
So more rigorously, I'm going to rewrite this limit by multiplying by 7x over 7x.
And by multiplying by 4x, over 4x, that hasn't changed my expression, I'm just multiplying by one and fancy forms.
But this is really useful.
Because if I regroup here, and write the sine 7x over the 7x, times the one over cosine 7x.
Now I'm going to write the Forex over the sign for x.
And I'm still left with a 7x from the top and a 4x.
From the bottom here, I can cancel out those x's.
And I can notice that this limit here, as x goes to 07, x is going to zero, so sine 7x over 7x is just going to be equal to one.
And similarly as x goes to zero, for x is going to zero.
So the limit of 4x ever signed for x is the reciprocal of one, it's also one.
And finally, this limit in the middle here, as x goes to 07, x is going to zero, so cosine of 7x is going to one, and everything in the world is going to one except the 7/4.
So this limit is seven forth.
these graphs provide strong evidence, but graphs can be misleading, and they're no substitute for a rigorous proof.
So for a pretty cool geometric and algebraic proof of these facts, please see the proof video for this section.
The fact that the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta is one is really handy when you want to approximate sine theta.

In this video, we found that the limit as theta goes to zero of sine theta over theta is equal to one.
And the limit as theta goes to zero of cosine theta minus one over theta is equal to zero.
There's a nice proof of these facts in a later video for this section.
When you compose two functions, you apply the first function.
And then you apply the second function to the output of the first function.
For example, the first function might compute population size from time in years.

When you compose two functions, you apply the first function.
And then you apply the second function to the output of the first function.
For example, the first function might compute population size from time in years.
So its input would be time in years, since a certain date, as output would be number of people in the population.
The second function g, might compute health care costs as a function of population size.
So it will take population size as input, and its output will be healthcare costs.
If you put these functions together, that is compose them, then you'll go all the way from time in years to healthcare costs.
This is your composition, g composed with F.
The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle, f of x is defined as follows.
g composed with f of x is G evaluated on f of x, we can think of it schematically and so diagram, f acts on a number x and produces a number f of x, then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number, g of f of x.
Our composition of functions g composed with F is the function that goes all the way from X to g of f of x.
Let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values.
If we want to find g composed with F of four, by definition, this means g of f of four.
To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside out.
So we start with the x value of four, and we find f of four using the table of values for f of x.
When x equals four, f of x is seven,
