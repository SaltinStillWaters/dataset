Proof of Trigonometric Limits and Derivatives.
terms.
And canceling the H's, notice that the X to the ends can So notice that all of the remaining terms have an H in them.
So if we factor out that H, we get an x to the n minus one, plus a bunch of other terms.
And canceling the H's, we get we get one term that doesn't have any ages in it, and another bunch of terms that all have H's in them, as h goes to zero, all these other terms drop out because they go to zero.
And what we're left with is simply n times x to the n minus one, which is exactly what we want for the power role.
I think that's a pretty good proof if you're comfortable with the binomial formula.
But if you haven't seen the binomial formula before, that might leave you feeling a little cold.
So I'm going to offer you another proof using the other form of the limit definition of derivative.
So let me clear some space here.
And I'll start over using this definition, f prime at a is the limit as x goes to a of our function evaluated at x.
So that's x to the n minus our function evaluated at a, that's a to the n over x minus a.
Again, I'm going to need to rewrite things in order to evaluate this limit, since it's currently in a zero over zero and determinant form.
So I'm going to rewrite the top by factoring out a copy of x minus a, which gives me x to the n minus one plus x to the n minus two A plus x to the n minus three A squared, you see the pattern here.
And I keep going until I get to x a to the n minus two and finally a to the n minus one, that's still over x minus a, you can verify this factoring formula, simply by multiplying out and checking that you In fact, do get x to the n minus a to the n, after all your intermediate terms cancel.
Now that I've factored, I can cancel my x minus a, and simply evaluate my limit by plugging in x equal to A to get a to the n minus one plus a to the n minus two A plus, and so on each of these terms is equal to a to the n minus one.
And there are a total of n terms, since we got them from the terms above that started with x to the n minus one and did with x to the zero.
So that's n terms.
So that means we've got a final sum of n times a to the n minus one for a derivative f prime of A, which is exactly what we wanted to show.
Next, I'll prove the constant multiple rule that says that if c is a real number constant, and f is a differentiable function, then the derivative of a constant times f is just the constant times the derivative of f.
Starting with the limit definition of derivative, I have that the derivative of C times f of x is the limit as h goes to zero of C times f of x plus h minus c times f of x over h.
Now if I factor out the constant C, from both of these terms, and actually I can pull it all the way out of the limit side, since the constant has nothing to do with h.
So now I get that was equal to the constant times the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h, which is just a constant times the derivative of f, which is what we wanted to prove.
one term that doesn't have any ages in it, and another bunch of terms that all have H's in them, as h goes to zero, all these other terms drop out because they go to zero.

So now I get that was equal to the constant times the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x over h, which is just a constant times the derivative of f, which is what we wanted to prove.
The difference rule can be proved just like the sum rule by writing out the definition of derivative and regrouping terms.
Or we could use kind of a sneaky shortcut, and put together two of our previous roles.
So if we think of f of x minus g of x as being f of x plus minus one times g of x, then we can use the sum rule to rewrite this as a
