Marginal Cost.
expression here.
Now my limit rules allow me to rewrite this limit as four separate limits, provided that these four limits do in fact exist, which that tell you show you in a moment that they do.
So this first limit here is just equal to g of x, because G is a continuous function.
G is continuous because by assumption it's differentiable, so it has to be continuous.
This second limit here, you'll recognize as the definition of the derivative of f, so that limit exists at equals d dx of f of x.
The third limit, well, f of x has nothing to do with age.
So that limit is just f of x.
And finally, the fourth limit is the derivative of g.
And we've done it.
Well, modulus some minor rearrangement, you'll see that this expression here, is exactly the same as this expression here, just with the order of the terms switched around.
Before we go on to prove the quotient rule, it'll be really handy to prove the reciprocal rule, which states that the derivative of reciprocal, one over f of x is given by negative the derivative of f of x divided by f of x squared.
So to prove this fact, let's start as usual, with the definition of derivative.
The derivative of one over f of x is the limit as h goes to zero of one over f of x plus x plus h minus one over f of x over h.
Now, these fractions here are just crying out to be combined by finding a common denominator that common denominators f of x plus h times f of x.
So let me do that.
I've just multiplied the first fraction by f of x over f of x and the second fraction by f of x plus h over f of x plus h in order to rewrite with a common denominator.
So that gives me f of x minus f of x plus h divided by f of x plus h times f of x.
And instead of dividing this whole thing by H, I'll multiply it by one of our age, which gives me another factor of H in the denominator.
Now, this expression here is looking a lot like the derivative of h minus one over f of x over h.
Now, these fractions here are just crying out to be combined by finding a common denominator that common denominators f of x plus h times f of x.
So let me do that.
I've just multiplied the first fraction by f of x over f of x and the second fraction by f of x plus h over f of x plus h in order to rewrite with a common denominator.
So that gives me f of x minus f of x plus h divided by f of x plus h times f of x.
And instead of dividing this whole thing by H, I'll multiply it by one of our age, which gives me another factor of H in the denominator.
Now, this expression here is looking a lot like the derivative of f.
f.
It's just in the reverse order.
So let me factor out a negative sign in order to let me switch that order here.
So this becomes f of x plus h minus f of x over h, and then I've got the times one over f of x plus h times f of x.
Now I can split this limit up first, I'll factor out the negative sign.
And then I'll write this product as a product of two limits, which I can do provided the component limits exist.
And I'll check that these limits do exist.
Let's see the first limit here.
The first limit here is just the derivative of It's just in the reverse order.
So let me factor out a negative sign in order to let me switch that order here.
So this becomes f of x plus h minus f of x over h, and then I've got the times one over f of x plus h times f of x.
Now I can split this limit up first, I'll factor out the negative sign.
And then I'll write this product as a product of two limits, which I can do provided the component limits exist.
And I'll check that these limits do exist.
Let's see the first limit here.
The first limit here is just the derivative of f.
f.
And the second limit here exists because f is continuous, f is continuous since is differentiable.
So by continuity, as H is going to zero, since x plus h is approaching x, f of x plus h is just approaching f of x.
And I can rewrite this limit as one over f of x times f of x.
