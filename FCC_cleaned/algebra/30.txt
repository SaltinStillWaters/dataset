Compound Interest.
exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts.
Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account that earns 3% interest every year.
If you make no deposits or withdrawals, how much money will you have accumulated after 10 years, because 3% of the money that's in the bank is getting added each year, the money in the bank gets multiplied by 1.
03 each year.
So after one year, the amount will be 200 times 1.
3, after two years 200 times one point O three squared, and and after t years 200 times one point O three to the t power.
So the function modeling the amount of money, I'll call it P of t is given by 200 times 1.
03 to the T.
More generally, if you invest a dollars at an annual interest rate of our for t years.
In the end, you'll have P of t equals a times one plus r to the T here r needs to be written as a decimal, so 0.
03 In our example, for the 3% annual interest rate.
Going back to our specific example, After 10 years, the amount of money is going to be P of 10 which is 200 times 1.
03 to the 10 which works out to 206 $68.
78 to the nearest cent.
In this problem, we've assumed that the interest accumulates once per year.
But in the next few examples, we'll see what happens when the interest rate accumulates more frequently, twice a year, or every month.
For example, let's deposit $300 in an account that earns 4.
5% annual interest compounded semi annually, this means two times a year or every six months.
A 4.
5% annual interest rate compounded two times a year means that we're actually getting 4.
5 over 2% interest, every time the interest is compounded.
That is every six months.
That's 2.
25% interest every half a year.
Note that 2.
25% is the same as 0.
02 to five as a decimal.
So every time we earn interest, our money gets multiplied by 1.
02 to five.
Let me make a chart of what happens.
After zero years, which is also zero half years, we have our original $300.
for half a year, that's one half year, our money gets earns interest one time, so we multiply the 300 by 1.
02 to five, after one year, that's two half years, our money earns interest two times.
So we multiply 300 by 1.
0225 squared.
continuing this way, after 1.
5 years, that's three half years, we have 300 times 1.
02 to five cubed.
And after two years or four half years, we have 300 times 1.
02 to five to the fourth.
In general, after t years, which is to T half years, our money will grow to 300 times 1.
02 to five to the two t power.
Because we've compounded interest to tee times our formula for our amount of money is P of t equals 300 times one point O two to five to the two t where t is the number of years.
To finish the problem, after seven years, we'll have P of $7, which is 300 times 1.
02 to five to the two times seven or 14 power.
And that works out to $409.
65 to the nearest cent.
In this next example, we're going to take out a loan for $1, 200 in annual interest rate of 6% compounded monthly.
Although loans and bank accounts might feel different, they're mathematically the same.
It's like from the bank's point of view, they're investing money in you and getting interest on their money from you.
So we can work them out with the same kind of math 6% annual interest rate compounded monthly means you're compounding 12 times a year.
So each time you compound interest, you're just going to get six over 12% interest.
That's point 5% interest.
And as a decimal, that's 0.
005.
Let's try it out again, what happens.
Time is zero, of course, you'll have the original loan amount of 1200.
After one year, that's 12 months, your loan has had interest added to it 12 times so it gets multiplied by 1.
05 to the 12th.
After two years, that's 24 months, it's had interest added to it 24 times, so it gets multiplied by 1.
05 to the 24th power.
Similarly, after three years or 36 months, your loan amount will be 1200 times 1.
05 to the 36th power.
And in general, after two years, that's 12 t months.
So the interest will be compounded 12 t times and so we have to raise the 1.
05 To the 12 t power.
This gives us the general formula for the money owed is P of t equals 1200 times 1.
05 to the 12 T, where T is the number of years.
In particular, after three years, we'll have to pay back a total of 1200 times 1.
05 to the 12 times three or 36 power, which works out to $1, 436.
02 to the nearest cent.
These last two problems follow a general pattern.
If A is the initial amount of the loan or bank account, and r is the annual interest rate, compounded n times per year, then our formula for the amount of money is going to be a times one plus r over n to the n t.
This formula exactly matches what we did in this problem.
First, we took the interest rate our which was 6%, and divided it by the number of compounding periods each year 12.
We wrote that as a decimal and added one to it.
That's where we got the 1.
05 from.
We raised this to not to the number of years, but to 12 times the number of years.
That's the number of compounding periods per year, times the number of years.
And we multiplied all that by the initial amount of money, which was 1200.
This formula for compound interest is a good one to memorize.
But it's also important to be able to reason your way through it, like we did in this chart.
There's one more type of compound interest.
And that's interest compounded continuously.
You can think of continuous compounding as the limit of compounding more and more frequently 10 times a year, 100 times a year 1000 times a year a million times a year.
In the limit, you get continuous compounding.
The formula for continuous compounding is P of t equals a times e to the RT, where p of t is the amount of money, t is the time in years.
A is the initial amount of money.
And R is the annual interest rate written as a decimal.
So 0.
025 in this problem from the 2.
5% annual interest rate.
He represents the famous constant Oilers constant, which is about 2.
718.
So in this problem, we have P of t is 4000 times e to the 0.
025 T.
And after five years, we'll have P of five, which is 4000 times e to the 0.
0 to five times five, which works out to $4, 532.
59 to the nearest cent.
To summarize, if R represents the annual interest rate written as a decimal, that is 2% would be 0.
02.
And t represents the number of years and a represents the initial amount of money, then for just simple annual interest compounded once a year.
Our formula is P of t is a times one plus r to the T for compound interest compounded n times per year.
Our formula is P of t is a times one plus r over n to the n T.
And for compound interest compounded continuously, we get P of t is a times e to the RT.
In this video, we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems, simple annual interest, interest compounded and times per year, and continuously compounded interest.
