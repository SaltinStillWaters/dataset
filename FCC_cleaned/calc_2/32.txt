Proof of the Ratio Test.
Or if we'd rather start with an index of one, we can rewrite that as D times n minus one plus a.
Notice these two expressions are exactly the same, if we just set k equal to n minus one, in particular, the starting value of n equals one here, if I plug in one for n, I get the equivalent starting value of K to be zero.
Let's read some more formulas for sequences.
In this first sequence, notice that consecutive terms always have the same ratio of 1/10.
In other words, each time n increases by one, a sub n gets multiplied by 1/10.
This is the same property that exponential functions have.
And in fact, we can write a sub n in the form of an exponential function with base 1/10.
But we need to multiply by the right initial value, so that when n is one, we'll get a first term of three, that correct initial value is 30.
As usual, we can check our answer by plugging in a few values of n, n equals 123.
And making sure we get back the terms in our sequence.
If we prefer to start with our index at zero, we can rewrite this as three times 1/10 to the nth power.
Since a value of zero for n in this formula, gives us three, just like a value of one for n in this formula gives us three.
In the second example, we again have a common ratio, if I divide the second term by the first term, I get a ratio of five halves.
And that's the same ratio as I get when I divide the third term by the second term.
So if I use an index starting with zero, I can write this series as 15 halves, which is the first term times five halves to the nth power.
If I prefer to start with my index at one, one way to do this is to let K equal n plus one and making a variable substitution.
When n is 0k, will be one.
And since K is n plus one, n is k minus one, so I can replace n with k minus one.
This gives the following representation of the sequence.
The third example has a common ratio of negative two thirds.
so we can write it as the initial term of three times that ratio, negative two thirds raised to the nth power, where n starts at zero.
Or, as above, we can write it as three times negative two thirds to the k minus one.
Now let's practice writing out a formula for the general term, a sub n of a sequence.
For this first sequence, notice that each term is three more than the previous term.
So this is like a linear function with slope three, each time that n goes up by one, our ace events go up by three.
And so I can write a sub n is three times n plus b, where B functions like my y intercept and a linear equation, to find B, I can plug in seven, four, a sub one that corresponds to an N value of one, and I get that B has to equal four.
So my general formula is three times n plus four, where n starts at one.
I can check this by plugging in a few values of n, like we did in the previous example, just to make sure it works.
Notice that it would also be possible to write this as three times n plus seven If we're willing to start with n equals zero instead of one, if we let n start with zero, then our first term functions like our y intercept.
This is an example of an arithmetic sequence, a sequence for which consecutive terms have the same common difference.
And in general, if A is the first term, and d is the common difference than an arithmetic sequence has the form d times k plus a, if our index is K and starts at zero, like it did over here.
Or if we'd rather start with an index of one, we can rewrite that as D times n minus one plus a.
Notice these two expressions are exactly the same, if we just set k equal to n minus one, in particular, the starting value of n equals one here, if I plug in one for n, I get the equivalent starting value of K to be zero.

Where k starts at one.
Sometimes people like to write the negative one separately.
The negative one to the power makes a series alternate between negative and positive terms.
These three sequences are all examples of geometric sequences, which are key sequences where consecutive terms have the same common ratio.
And in general, if A is the first term and RS, the common ratio than a geometric sequence can be written in the form of a times r to the n, where n starts at zero, or as a times r to the n minus one, where n starts at one.
These next two sequences are neither arithmetic sequences nor geometric sequences.
Since they're terms neither have common differences nor common ratios, but I can still figure out a formula for the nth term just by looking for the pattern.
In this example, since the terms are alternating, if I start at n equals one, I know that 90 to negative one to the nth power to make it start with a negative and then alternate, positive, negative Again, the numerator looks like it's just twice n.
And the denominator looks like it's always a perfect square, starting
