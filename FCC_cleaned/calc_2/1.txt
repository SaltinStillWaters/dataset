Volumes of Solids of Revolution.
a positive area.
If instead, f of x is less than or equal to g of x, then you'll need to switch around your subtraction and take the integral of g of x minus f of x dx instead, in order to get a positive area.
One way to remember what to do is just to write the integral as the integral from a to b of the top y value minus the bottom y value, dx.
Remembering that you'll need to replace the top y value and the bottom y value with functions of x before you can integrate.
Let's look at an example.
We want to find the area between the curve y equals x squared plus x and y equals three minus x squared.
x squared plus x is a parabola pointing upwards.
So that must be the red curve here, while three minus x squared is a parabola pointing downwards.
So that must be this blue curve.
We know that area is given by the integral from our starting x value to our ending x value of our top y values minus our bottom y values, all integrated with respect to x, our top y values are given by the equation three minus x squared, and our bottom y values are given by the equation x squared plus x.
Now we still need to figure out the values of a and b, the bounds of integration.
And from the graph, it looks like a should be maybe about negative one and a half, and B should be about one, since that's where the green area starts and ends in the horizontal direction.
But to find exact values of a and b, the easiest thing to do is to set these two equations equal to each other and solve for x.
So I'll set three minus x squared equal to x squared plus x, I can add x squared to both sides to get to x squared plus x minus three equals zero.
This factors into 2x plus three, and x minus one, and therefore x has to equal negative three halves and or x equals one, just like we thought from the graph.
So we can finish doing our setup, our bounds of integration are from negative three halves to one, and I can simplify my integrand here.
This is three minus x squared minus x squared minus x.
Or in other words, the integral from negative three halves to one of minus 2x squared minus x plus three dx.
This integrates to minus 2x cubed over three my minus x squared over two plus 3x, evaluated between one and negative three halves.
Now I just need to plug in my bounds of integration and then simplify to get 125 20 fourths as the area.

In this video, we saw that the area between two curves in between the x values of a and b can be given by the integral from a to b have the top y values minus the bottom y values.
dx, were the top y values and bottom y values are functions of x.
More specifically, if the top curve is given by y equals f of x, and the bottom curve is y equals g of x, then this integral is the integral from a to b of f of x minus g of x, dx.
In this video, we'll calculate the volumes of solids of revolution.
A solid of revolution is a three dimensional object that can be formed by rotating a region of the plane around an axis.
volumes formed by rotating a region of the plane around a line are called solids of revolution.
In this figure on the left, this three dimensional object is formed by rotating a region of the plane shaped like this, around the x axis, the solid on the right can be formed by rotating a crescent shaped region of the plane like this, again, around the x axis.
If we slice these two solids of revolution, using planes perpendicular to the x axis, on the left side, our cross sections look like disks.

If we slice these two solids of revolution, using planes perpendicular to the x axis, on the left side, our cross sections look like disks.
A disc here means the inside of a circle.
The figure on the right is different because it's hollow inside.
And when we slice it by planes perpendicular to the x axis, we get cross sections that are shaped like washers.
A washer here means the region in between two concentric circles.
So for solids of revolution, the cross sections can have the shape of a disk, or the shape of a washer.
The area of a disk is given by the familiar formula, pi r squared, where r is the radius.
And the area of a washer can be written as pi times r outer squared minus pi times our inner squared, where our outer is the radius of the big circle, and our inner is the radius of the little circle.
This formula works because the area of the washer is just the area of the larger circle minus the area of the inside smaller circle.
Now we know that the volume of any solid that can be sliced into cross sections using planes perpendicular to the x axis is given by v is the integral from x equals a
