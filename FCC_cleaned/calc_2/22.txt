L'Hospital's Rule.
to get 1/5 sine to the fifth of x plus C.
The next integral, the integral of sine to the fourth x times cosine cubed x dx can also be handled with a similar use of the tuition with a bit more work.
First, I'm going to rewrite the integral as the integral of sine to the fourth x times cosine squared x times cosine of x dx.
I'm rewriting the cosine cubed of x as cosine squared of x times cosine x in the hopes that I can use cosine of x dx as my d u, like I did in the previous problem.
Now if we have d u, as cosine of x, dx, we're going to need you to be sine of x.
But unlike the previous problem, I can't just replace sine of the fourth x with you to the fourth and cosine x dx with D, U and be done.
Because I've got this cosine squared x hanging around that I need to deal with.
I wish I didn't have that cosine squared x, I wish everything else over here was just written in terms of sine.
Now, as you might realize, it's not hard for me to get my wish.
We know from the Pythagorean identity, that cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x is equal to one.
So cosine squared of x can be written as one minus sine squared x.
Making that substitution, I can now rewrite my integral entirely in terms of you.
And do now if I multiply things out, this becomes easy to integrate, I get 1/5 u to the fifth minus 1/7 u to the seventh plus C.
And I can rewrite this in terms of x.
To recap, we separated out one copy of cosine x to be part of our D U.
And then we converted the rest of the cosines in the signs isn't a Pythagorean identity.
This allowed us to do use of the tuition with u equal to sine x and evaluate the integral.
This same technique with some modifications works on a lot of other problems.
In this next problem, if we tried separating out one copy of cosine of x to be part of our do, we'd run into problems, because we just have one copy of cosine x left.
And we can't use the Pythagorean identity can to convert a single cosine into signs.
Well, I guess technically, we could do something like this.
But then we'd have to introduce a plus or minus sign and a square root sign into our integrand, which would make things difficult to integrate.
It's a lot easier if we can just use the cosine squared x is equal to one minus sine squared x identity to replace our cosines with signs.
But this identity only applies if we have an even power of cosines leftover that we want to convert.
So instead of trying to save out a copy of cosine x, let's say about a copy of sine x instead.
So we'll rewrite our integral as the integral of sine to the fourth of x times a sine of x.
And we'll keep the cosine squared x and the dx.
Now we want the sine x to be part of our D U.
So let's set u equal to cosine of x.
That way d u is equal to negative sine of x dx.
And so sine of x dx is equal to negative d U.
since u is equal to cosine x, this time, we want to replace all of our stray signs with cosines.
We know that sine squared of x is equal to one minus cosine squared of x by the Pythagorean identity.
So let's rewrite this sine to the fourth as sine squared of x squared.
That allows us to substitute in one minus cosine squared of x for sine squared of x And now we can replace everything with us and d is I'll bring out the negative sign and multiply things out.
One minus u squared squared is one minus two u squared plus u to the fourth.
And this multiplies out to us squared minus two u to the fourth plus u to the sixth.
Now I can integrate, distribute my negative sign.
And finally, plug in cosine of x for you.
That completes this problem.
In this video, we'll use use substitution and the Pythagorean identity.
To evaluate integrals with at least one odd power of sine or cosine.
The idea is to separate off one copy from the odd power that one copy becomes part of our D U.
and the remaining even power gets converted using the Pythagorean identity.
In this case, we convert sine squared into one minus cosine squared.
This allows us to do the use substitution and evaluate the integral.
In this video, we'll evaluate integrals of trig functions involving only even powers of sine and cosine.
There are three trig identities that will come in handy here, the first ones that are familiar, the factory and identity.
The second one's an identity that allows us to rewrite cosine squared of x in terms of cosine of 2x.
And the third one is in nd that lets us write sine squared of x.
Also in terms of cosine of 2x.
The only difference between the second and third is the fact that one's cosine squared and one sine squared.
But the other difference is the plus sign versus the minus sign here.
To recap, we separated out one copy of cosine x to be part of our D U.
And then we converted the rest of the cosines in the signs isn't a Pythagorean identity.
This allowed us to do use of the tuition with u equal to sine x and evaluate the integral.
