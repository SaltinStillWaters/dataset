there's a number.
And such that a sub n is less than omega for a little n bigger than or equal to capital N.
Please take a moment and try to come up with an example of a sequence that converges, a sequence that diverges to infinity or negative infinity, and a sequence that's bounded but still diverges.
One example of a convergent sequence is a sequence whenever n, this sequence converges to zero, since the limit as n goes to infinity of one over N is zero.
A divergent sequence is two to the N.
Since the limit as n goes to infinity of two to the n is infinity.
One example of a sequence that's bounded, but still diverges is negative one to the n.
The sequence alternates between negative one and one, depending on whether n is odd, or even.
So it's bounded in between negative one and one.
But it still diverges because the limit does not exist.
Since the sequence doesn't settle at a single value.
The rest of this video will give some techniques for proving that sequences converge.
The first technique is to use standard calculus tricks for finding limits of functions.
Even though a sequence is only defined on positive integers.
Sometimes it's possible to find a function defined on all positive real numbers that agrees with our sequence on the integers.
In other words, the terms as of n are equal to f of n for this function F.
When this happens, then if the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x equals L, then the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n also equals out, the red dots are converging to the same limit as the blue function.
So a lot of times, we can figure out if a sequence converges by replacing the terms a sub n with F of X for some appropriate function, and then using lobaton ruler, other tricks from calculus one to show that the function limit exists.
Let's try that for the following example.
When the indices are missing, as in this example, we'll assume that n starts at one and goes to infinity.
In order to prove that this sequence converges, let's instead look at the function f of x equals ln one plus two e to the x over x, where x is a real number.
Now let's look at the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x.
That's the limit as x goes to infinity of ln one plus two e to the x over x.
And as x goes to infinity in the x goes to infinity, so one plus two times e to the x goes to infinity, which means ln of that goes to infinity.
So the numerator is going to infinity as x goes to infinity.
And so as the denominator, we have an infinity over an infinity indeterminate form.
So we can apply lobby towels rule and take the derivative of the numerator over the derivative of the denominator, the derivative of the numerator one over one plus two times e to the x times two times e to the x using the chain rule, and the derivative of the denominator is just one.
We can take derivatives here, because we're thinking of x as a real number, not just an integer.
Simplifying, we still have an infinity over infinity indeterminate form.
So let's take the derivatives again, the derivative of the numerator is now two times e to the x, and the derivative of the denominator is also two times e to the x.
So their limit here is one.
Since our function converges to one, our sequence also converges to one.
So this original sequence converges to one.
the derivative of the numerator is now two times e to the x, and the derivative of the denominator is also two times e to the x.
So their limit here is one.
Since our function converges to one, our sequence also converges to one.
So this original sequence converges to one.
Another technique for proving that sequences converge is to use the squeeze theorem and trap the sequence between two simpler sequences that converge to the same limit.
In this example, since sine and cosine are both bounded in between one and negative one, we know that cosine of n plus sine of n can't be any bigger than two, certainly, or on a smaller than negative two.
If I divide all sides of this inequality by n to the two thirds, we can see that the original sequence is bounded in between negative two over n to the two thirds and two over n to the two thirds.
Notice that n to the two thirds has to be positive, since as usual, we're assuming that n starts as one and goes to infinity.
And so dividing by n to the two thirds does not switch the inequality signs.
Now it's easy to check that the limit as n goes to infinity of negative two over n to the two thirds is zero, since as n goes to infinity, and to the two thirds also goes to infinity.
Similarly, the limit as n goes to infinity of two over n to the two thirds is zero.
Since these two limits are the same, we know by the squeeze theorem, that the limit of our sequence in the middle has to exist at equals zero.
Also, it's a remarkable fact that I won't prove here that if a sub n is bounded, and monotonic, then it has to converge.
You might get some intuition for this fact, by looking at a graph.
If the ace of ends are monotonically, increasing, for example, but are bounded, then there's no place for these events to go.
And they can't oscillate up and down.
Because they're monotonically increasing.
So it makes intuitive sense that they have to settle on some limit.
A fun example of this fact is a sequence that starts point 1.
1 2.
12 3.
1234, and so on.
Where we just keep stringing together the counting numbers as our decimal, the sequence is certainly monotonically increasing, and is bounded.
Since every term of the sequence is greater than zero and less than, say, point five.
So we have a bounded monotonic sequence.
And so the sequence has to converge.
Now, what it actually converges to is a little mysterious, since it doesn't converge to some number we're already familiar with like, like, point six, or pi over three or something like that.
But it does converge to some real number.
And that real number is called champion nouns constant.
And it has some interesting properties.
And of course, it has a decimal expansion that's easy to to come up with, since you get it just by stringing together the counting numbers.
If you can recognize a sequence to be a geometric sequence, then it's pretty easy to decide whether it converges or diverges.
Recall that a geometric sequence is a sequence of the form a times r to the n minus one where n runs from one to infinity.
Or sometimes it's written as a times r to the n, where n runs from zero to infinity.
Let's try to figure out for what values of our the sequence r to the n converges.
It's not really important here whether and starts at zero or starts So one, since when we talk about convergence, we're talking about the behavior of the terms as n goes to infinity.
So the first few terms really don't matter.
if r is greater than one, then the sequence r to the n is an increasing sequence.
In fact, for the sequence r to the n, if we replace n with x, and look at the function f of x equals r to the x, that's an exponential function.
And if we're assuming r is greater than one, the base for our exponential functions is greater than one.
So we know that the limit as x goes to infinity of our to the X is infinity, which means that our sequence r to the n also has to diverge to infinity.
Another technique for proving that sequences converge is to use the squeeze theorem and trap the sequence between two simpler sequences that converge to the same limit.
In this example, since sine and cosine are both bounded in between one and negative one, we know that cosine of n plus sine of n can't be any bigger than two, certainly, or on a smaller than negative two.

And so dividing by n to the two thirds does not switch the inequality signs.
Now it's easy to check that the limit as n goes to infinity of negative two over n to the two thirds is zero, since as n goes to infinity, and to the two thirds also goes to infinity.
Similarly, the limit as n goes to infinity of two over n to the two thirds is zero.
Since these two limits are the same, we know by the squeeze theorem, that the limit of our sequence in the middle has to exist at equals zero.
