root of one plus three halves x to the one half squared dx.
After simplifying a little bit, we can use use substitution to rewrite this.
So we get the integral from 13 fourths, to 10 of the square root of u times four ninths do which integrates to u to the three halves divided by three halves, times four ninths, evaluated between 10 and 13 fourths, which after some computation works out to 1/27 times at the square root of 10 minus 13, the squared of 13 or approximately 7.
6 units, which seems about right, based on the graph, taking into account the fact that this scale here is by twos on the y axis.
In this video, we found the formula for the arc length of a curve.
If the curve stretches from x equals a to x equals b, then the arc length is given by the integral from a to b of the square root of one plus f prime of x squared dx.
This video introduces the idea of work from physics and the key role of integration in doing work calculations.
If a constant force f is applied to move an object a distance d, then the work done to move the object is defined to be work equals force times distance, or in symbols, w equals F times d.
The units of force can be given in metric units, or in bold fashion, English units.
Since force is mass times acceleration, the units of force are going to be units of mass, which are kilograms, times units of acceleration, meters per second squared.
This collection of units is also called a Newton.
In English units, force is given typically, in terms of pounds.
Now the units of work since work is force times distance, and distance in metric units is in meters.
That gives units for work of kilograms meters squared per second squared, or we can write it work as Newton meters.
And these collection of units is also given its own name, which is the joule.
If we're using English units for work, work again is force times distance.
So the units become pounds times feet are usually this is written instead, as a foot pound.
Now, if I give you my weight in pounds, I weigh about 140 pounds.
Those pounds are already and I get it a force.
So that 140 pounds, my weight is also telling the force of gravity on my body.
But if I tell you instead, that my mass is 63.
5 kilograms, well, that's a unit of mass not a unit of force.
So if I want to know the force, due to gravity on my body, I'm gonna have to multiply that 63.
5 by the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.
8 meters per second squared.
That product works out to be 622.
3 kilogram meters per second squared.
Notice that we're now have the right units for force, we could also say, that's the force of gravity on my body is 622.
3 Newtons.
Now that we familiarize ourselves with units a bit, let's do some examples.
As our first example, how much work is done to lift a two pound book off the floor onto a shelf that's five feet high?
Well, we know that work is force times distance, and two pounds is already a unit of force.
And distance is five feet.
So the work done is 10 foot pounds.
Now let's do the same problem in metric units.
The two pound book is actually a naught point nine kilogram book, and we're lifting it off the floor onto a shelf that's about 1.
5 meters high.
Well, work is still force times distance.
But now the force is point nine kilograms times the acceleration due to gravity 9.
8 meters per second squared, times our distance of 1.
5 meters.
That gives us a product of 13.
23 kilograms meters squared per second squared, or in other words, 13.
23 jewels.
In the previous two examples, force was constant, so we could just multiply force by distance to get work.
Now let's consider the case where force is not constant.
Let's say a particle moves along the x axis from a point x equals a to a point x equals b.
According to a force, F of x, that's a function of x and varies with x.
How much work is done in moving a particle although the force is not constant, on the whole interval from a to b, if we divide up that interval, into a bunch of little sub intervals, each of width delta x, then on any particular sub interval The force is going to be approximately constant, it's not going to change a whole lot on a tiny little sub interval.
As usual, let's pick a sample point exabyte star in the eye sub interval for each little sub interval.
exabytes star could be the left endpoint of the sub interval, the right endpoint or any point in the middle.
Now, on the AI sub interval, the force is approximately constant is approximately equal to f at EXA biostar.
Therefore, the work on that I sub interval is approximately equal to this constant f x sub i star times the distance that the particle is going on that sub interval, that that distance is just the length of the sub interval delta x.
Instead of thinking of the big picture of the particle going all the way from A to B, I'm thinking of it going just along the first sub interval with the approximately constant force at a distance of delta x.
And then it's going to go the second sub interval, again, the forces approximately constant times the distance of delta x.
And then we'll do some more work getting along the third sub interval, another proximately, constant force times delta x.
And so on each little tiny bit of the way, I'll get another little chunk of work.
And then I can get the entire amount of work by adding all those little chunks of work up.
So the total work done is going to be the sum from i equals one to n, where n is the number of sub intervals of the work done on each sub interval, which is f of x sub i star times distance delta x.
I should say this is approximately the total work, in order to get the actual total work, we'll need to take a limit as we use more and more skinnier and skinnier subintervals.
So the limit as n goes to infinity of this Riemann sum, the limit of a Riemann sum is an integral.
So we've got the integral of the force f of x, dx, and we'll integrate between the minimum x value of a and the maximum x value of b.
And that's our formula for work.
Now that we familiarize ourselves with units a bit, let's do some examples.
