sequence.
In fact, for the sequence r to the n, if we replace n with x, and look at the function f of x equals r to the x, that's an exponential function.
And if we're assuming r is greater than one, the base for our exponential functions is greater than one.
So we know that the limit as x goes to infinity of our to the X is infinity, which means that our sequence r to the n also has to diverge to infinity.
If instead, r is equal to one, then r to the n is just one to the n, which is just a sequence of ones, so that converges to one.
if r is between zero and one, then r to the n, is decreasing.
This time, it's like the exponential function f of x equals r to the x with the base between zero and one.
And so the limit of that exponential function, as x goes to infinity is going to be equals zero.
Therefore, the sequence also converges to zero.
Of course, if r equals exactly zero, and the sequence is just a sequence of zeros, so it also converges to zero.
Next, let's look at the case when r is between negative one and zero.
Now, the sequence of rd ends are going to oscillate between positive and negative numbers that get smaller and smaller and magnitude as n goes to infinity.
That's because we get from one number to the next by multiplying by r, which is a negative number of magnitude less than one.
So our limit as n goes to infinity of our A to the ends, is going to be zero again.
Another way of thinking about this case, is by thinking about the squeeze theorem, since r to the n is always less than or equal to the absolute value of r to the n, which is o n is always greater than or equal to negative the absolute value of r to the n.
Technically, r to the n is always exactly equal to the absolute value are the n when n is even, so that art of the N is positive.
And it's always exactly equal to the negative of the absolute value of r, the N, when n is odd, so that are the n is, is negative.
But in any case, the inequality still does technically hold.
And so therefore, since by the squeeze theorem, the limit of the left terms is zero, and the limit of the right terms is zero.
As we noted before, the limit of the middle term also has to be zero.
So our sequence converges to zero.
Now, if r is equal to negative one, then our sequence r to the n is just negative one to the n, which alternates between negative one and one.
And so that sequence diverges.
Finally, if r is less than negative one, then to get from one term to the next, we're multiplying by negative number that has magnitude bigger than one.
And so our terms are going to oscillate between positive and negative numbers, but they're going to be going up in magnitude.
And so the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n, does not exist.
And we see that our sequence diverges.
If we look through all these cases, we see that the sequence r to the n converges to zero, when r is between negative one and one.
it converges to one when r is exactly equal to one, and it diverges when r is bigger than one or less than negative one.
All right, then Summary below.
In fact, almost the same thing as true, when we look at the sequence a times r to the n, where A is any real number, the sequence a times r to the n converges to zero, when r is between negative one and one.
it converges to a, when r is equal to one.
And it diverges when r is less than negative one, or greater than one.
This follows because multiplying all the terms in the sequence by a just multiplies the limit by a and zero times as zero, well, one times i is a.
So anytime you encounter a geometric sequence, that is a sequence that can be written in the form of a times r to the n, If instead, r is equal to one, then r to the n is just one to the n, which is just a sequence of ones, so that converges to one.
if r is between zero and one, then r to the n, is decreasing.
This time, it's like the exponential function f of x equals r to the x with the base between zero and one.
And so the limit of that exponential function, as x goes to infinity is going to be equals zero.
Therefore, the sequence also converges to zero.
Of course, if r equals exactly zero, and the sequence is just a sequence of zeros, so it also converges to zero.
Next, let's look at the case when r is between negative one and zero.
Now, the sequence of rd ends are going to oscillate between positive and negative numbers that get smaller and smaller and magnitude as n goes to infinity.
That's because we get from one number to the next by multiplying by r, which is a negative number of magnitude less than one.
So our limit as n goes to infinity of our A to the ends, is going to be zero again.
Another way of thinking about this case, is by thinking about the squeeze theorem, since r to the n is always less than or equal to the absolute value of r to the n, which is o n is always greater than or equal to negative the absolute value of r to the n.
Technically, r to the n is always exactly equal to the absolute value are the n when n is even, so that art of the N is positive.
And it's always exactly equal to the negative of the absolute value of r, the N, when n is odd, so that are the n is, is negative.
But in any case, the inequality still does technically hold.
And so therefore, since by the squeeze theorem, the limit of the left terms is zero, and the limit of the right terms is zero.
As we noted before, the limit of the middle term also has to be zero.

This follows because multiplying all the terms in the sequence by a just multiplies the limit by a and zero times as zero, well, one times i is a.
So anytime you encounter a geometric sequence, that is a sequence that can be written in the form of a times r to the n, you can know that it converges if r is bigger than negative one and less than or equal to one.
This sequence here, although it looks really complicated, it's really a geometric sequence in disguise.
One way to see this is by simplifying the form of the terms, so this is negative one to the t, e to the t times e to the minus one over three to the T times three squared.
This is the same thing as negative e over three to the T times one over three squared times E.
Now this is looking like the tail end of a geometric sequence, where A is one over three squared times E, and R, the common ratio is minus e over three, say the tail end, because we have T starting at three instead of zero.
Now since he is less than three, the magnitude of our is got to be smaller than one.
In other words, our as a negative number, that's between negative one and zero, and therefore, the tail end of this geometric sequence converges.
