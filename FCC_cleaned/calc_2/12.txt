two to five.
We know that the average value of G is given by the integral from two to five of one over one minus 5x dx divided by the length of that interval.
I'm going to use use of the tuition to integrate.
So I'm going to set u equal to one minus 5x.
So d u is negative five dx.
In other words, dx is negative 1/5 times do.
Looking at my bounds of integration, when x is equal to two, u is equal to one minus five times two, which is negative nine.
And when x is equal to five, u is equal to negative 24.
substituting into my integral, I get the integral from negative nine to negative 24 of one over u times negative 1/5.
Do and that's divided by three.
Now dividing by three is same as multiplying by 1/3.
And as I integrate, I'm going to pull the negative 1/5 out, and then take the integral of one over u, that's ln of the absolute value of u, evaluated in between negative 24 and negative nine.
The absolute value signs are important here, because they prevent me from trying to take the natural log of negative numbers.
To evaluate, I get negative 1/15 times ln of 24 minus ln of nine, I can use my log rules to simplify and get negative 1/15 ln of 24 over nine, that's negative 1/15 ln of eight thirds, and as a decimal, that's approximately negative 0.
0654.
So I found the average value of G.
Now my next question is, does g ever achieve that average value, in other words, is there a number c in the interval from two to five for which GFC equals its average value?
Well, one way to find out is just to set GSC equal to GS average value.
In other words, set one over one minus five c equal to negative 1/15 ln of eight thirds, and try to solve for C.
There are lots of ways to solve this
