Arclength.
y equals 1/4 X.
We know our volume is given by the integral of pi times our outer squared minus pi times our inner squared.
And since our washers are thin in the x direction, we know we'll need to integrate dx, our bounds of integration are just our lowest x value of zero, and our largest x value, which is where these two curves intersect, which is an x value of eight.
We can confirm that the two curves intersect when x equals eight by setting them equal to each other.
And solving for x, dividing both sides by x to the 1/3.
And multiplying both sides by four gives us four equals x to the two thirds.
And raising both sides to the three halves power gives us x equals four to three halves, or x equals eight.
This confirms we have the correct bound of integration here.
Now we need to figure out a formula for the outer radius as a function of x and a formula for the inner radius.
Also, This confirms we have the correct bound of integration here.
Now we need to figure out a formula for the outer radius as a function of x and a formula for the inner radius.
Also, since the outer circle is swept out by the curve y equals cube root of x, the outer radius is just given by the y coordinate of this curve as a function of x, that's the cube root of x.
Now the inner radius is given by the y coordinate of this line, and the y coordinate of this line as a function of x is 1/4 x.
So we set up an equation for the volume of our solid and I routine computation gives us a volume of 128 fifteenth's times pi.
Now let's switch gears and rotate this region around the y axis instead.
Our cross sections are still washers, but this time the washers are thin in the y direction.
So we're going to be integrating with respect to y.
Our bounds of integration are also y values and start at the minimum y value of zero and the maximum Y value of two, that corresponds to this intersection, where x equals eight, and y, which is the cube root of x, or 1/4 times x is then equal to two.
For this problem, we need our our outer and our inner to the functions of y.
From the picture, we see that our outer is actually the x coordinate on this line.
The line has the equation y equals 1/4 x.
And so x is equal to four y.
So that gives us our outer as a function of y.
defined our inner, we can do the same sort of thing using the x coordinate of the curve, y equals cube root of x.
But writing that x coordinate in terms of y, we have y equals the cube root of x means that x is equal to y cubed.
And so our inner is equal to y cubed as a function of y.
putting this all together, we have an equation for volume.
We can simplify this and integrate to get an answer of 512 pi over 21.
In this video, we calculated the volumes of solids of revolution, using the disk and the washer methods, and the following formulas.
One way to calculate the volume of a loaf of bread is to slice it into slices, and calculate the volume of each slice separately.
That's the idea to keep in mind as we cover this topic, on volumes using cross sections.
A lot of three dimensional objects are kind of like loaves of bread, and can be naturally sliced into slabs or slices like this.
Let's suppose we've sliced our object into n slabs, we'll call them s one s two through sn in this picture, and is seven, here's s one, here's s two, here's s3, and so on, we'll assume we've sliced in such a way that each slice is the same thickness, we'll call that thickness delta x.
Well, the volume of the solid is just the sum of the volumes of the slices.
And sigma notation, we can write this as the sum from i equals one to n, the number of slabs volume of s by the I slab.
Now the volume of the slab is approximately its cross sectional area times its width.
By cross sectional area of the slab, I mean the area of the front or the back part of the slice, where you might spread peanut butter.
Well, now, as you've noticed from making peanut butter sandwiches, the area of the front of the slice might be slightly different from the area of the back of the slice.
So what we'll do is for each interval, I, each slab will just pick a sample point x vystar, that's in that I've interval, it could be on the left endpoint, or it could be on the right endpoint, or it could be in the middle somewhere.
And we'll just look at the cross sectional area, I'll call it a at x, y star that represents the area if I were to go karate chop right at that x y star and figure out the cross sectional area at that point.
since the outer circle is swept out by the curve y equals cube root of x, the outer radius is just given by the y coordinate of this curve as a function of x, that's the cube root of x.
Now the inner radius is given by the y coordinate of this line, and the y coordinate of this line as a function of x is 1/4 x.
