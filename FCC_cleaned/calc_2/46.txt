intensive, and makes use of exponent rules.
If we look at the basic term, and rewrite it using exponent rules, this is three to the two i times three to the minus three, I can rewrite the three to the two is three squared to the I and the three to the minus three and the denominator becomes a three cubed and the numerator.
Now I can group together all the pieces that are raised to the nth power.
And write this as negative 1/9 to the i times three cubed, or 27 times negative one night to the I reading like this, I can see that every time I increases by one, I get another factor of negative one nine multiplied in my expression.
And therefore, the this is a geometric series with ratio negative one nine, as I saw before, now, you might think that the first term should be 27.
But remember that it doesn't start at zero, it starts at two.
So the first term is going to be what I get I get when I plug in the first value of i.
So that's 27 times negative one nine squared, which works out to 1/3.
as before.
So we do have a geometric series with first term of 1/3, a common ratio of negative 1/9.
In fact, we could rewrite it in a more standard form as the sum of 1/3 times negative 1/9 to the k, where k ranges from zero to infinity.
Since k equals zero, and this expression corresponds to i equals two in this expression, k is equal to, can be thought of as equal to i minus two.
And this is really a reindexing tugann simplification to get from this version to this version.
A geometric sequence is a sequence of the form a a times r, a times r squared, a times r cubed, and so on.
For some numbers a and r.
this can be written in the wrapped up notation, a times r to the k, where k goes from zero to infinity.
For example, if a is three, and r is one half, the sequence would be three, three halves, three fourths, three eighths, and so on, which could be written as three times one half to the k, where k ranges from zero to infinity.
A geometric series is the series you get by adding all these numbers up.
So that would be a plus a times r plus a times r squared, and so on, which can be written in summation notation is the sum from K equals zero to infinity of A times r to the K.
For our example, our series would be the following, which could be written as the sum from K equals zero to infinity of three times one half to the K.
Sometimes you might get a geometric series that's in disguise, like this one.
If I write out the first few terms, notice that we're told to start with i equals two.
So plugging in i equals two here, I get negative one, squared over three to the two times two minus three, that's one over three.
If I plug in i equals three, I get negative one cubed, that's over three to the two times three minus three, or negative one over three cubed, negative 127.
When I go four, I get one over 243.
If I look at the ratio of consecutive terms, negative 127 divided by 1/3, is negative one night.
Similarly, the ratio here is also negative one nights, suggesting that we might have a geometric series with ratio R of negative 1/9.
And first term coming from here, of 1/3.
But there's another way to see this that's less arithmetic intensive, and makes use of exponent rules.
If we look at the basic term, and rewrite it using exponent rules, this is three to the two i times three to the minus three, I can rewrite the three to the two is three squared to the I and the three to the minus three and the denominator becomes a three cubed and the numerator.
Now I can group together all the pieces that are raised to the nth power.
And write this as negative 1/9 to the i times three cubed, or 27 times negative one night to the I reading like this, I can see that every time I increases by one, I get another factor of negative one nine multiplied in my expression.

And this is really a reindexing tugann simplification to get from this version to this version.
As you may know, a geometric sequence converges to zero, when the common ratio R is between negative one and one, it converges to a, when r is equal to one, and it diverges.
Otherwise, when r is less than or equal to negative one, or when r is greater than one.
We're assuming
