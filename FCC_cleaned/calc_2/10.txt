Integrals Involving Odd Powers of Sine and Cosine.
of two times 10 to the six meters above the Earth's surface.
So that's a distance r of 6.
4 plus two, or 8.
4 times 10 to the six meters from the earth center.
My only variable for this integral is R.
So let me pull out the constants.
And I'll rewrite the one over r squared as r to the minus two.
Now I can integrate an R to the minus two becomes r to the minus one over minus one Rewrite one more time and substitute in for R to get a preliminary answer of negative GE, capital M lowercase n times negative 3.
72024 times 10 to the minus eight.
Now I still need to plug in for capital G, capital M and lowercase m, my negatives cancel here.
And I have G is 6.
67 times 10 to the minus 11.
capital M, the mass of the Earth is six times 10 to the 24, and lowercase and the mass the satellite was 1000 kilograms.
Multiplying all these numbers together, gives us a final answer of approximately 1.
5 times 10 to the 10th.
jewels.
To put this number in perspective, this is about the same amount of work done by a car in a year, or by the human heart beating for about 400 years.
In this video, we saw that for a constant force work is just equal to the force times distance.
But for a variable force work is equal to the integral of force with respect to distance.
This video introduces the idea of an average value of a function.
To take the average of a finite list of numbers, we just add the numbers up and divide by n, the number of numbers.
In summation notation, we write the sum from i equals one to n of Q i all divided by n.
But defining the average value of a continuous function is a little different.
Because a function can take on infinitely many values on an interval from a to be, we could estimate the average value of the function by sampling it at a finite Li many evenly spaced x values.
I'll call them x one through x n.
And let's assume that they're spaced a distance of delta x apart, then the average value of f at these sample points is just the sum of the values of f divided by n, the number of values are in summation notation, the sum from i equals one to n of f of x i all divided by n.
This is an approximate average value of f, since we're just using n sample points.
But the approximation gets better as the number of sample points n gets bigger and bigger.
So we could define the average as the limit as n goes to infinity of the sample average.
I'd like to make this look more like a Riemann sum.
So I need to get delta x in there.
So I'm just going to multiply the top and the bottom by delta x.
And notice that n times delta x is just the length of the interval b minus a.
Now as the number of sample points goes to infinity, delta x, the distance between them goes to zero.
So I can rewrite my limit as the limit as delta x goes to zero of the sum of FX II times delta x divided by b minus a.
Now the limit of this Riemann sum in the numerator is just the integral from a to b of f of x dx.
And so the average value of the function is given by the integral on the interval from a to b divided by the length of the interval.
I'm starting at the Earth's surface.
So that's a distance of 6.
4 times 10 to the six meters from the center of the earth, since that's the earth radius.
And I'm ending at a height of two times 10 to the six meters above the Earth's surface.
So that's a distance r of 6.
4 plus two, or 8.
4 times 10 to the six meters from the earth center.
