Proof of the Angle Sum Formulas.
adding all those little chunks of work up.
So the total work done is going to be the sum from i equals one to n, where n is the number of sub intervals of the work done on each sub interval, which is f of x sub i star times distance delta x.
I should say this is approximately the total work, in order to get the actual total work, we'll need to take a limit as we use more and more skinnier and skinnier subintervals.
So the limit as n goes to infinity of this Riemann sum, the limit of a Riemann sum is an integral.
So we've got the integral of the force f of x, dx, and we'll integrate between the minimum x value of a and the maximum x value of b.
And that's our formula for work.
Let's look at a physical example.
How much work is required to lift 1000 kilograms satellite from the Earth's surface to an altitude of two times 10 to the six meters above the Earth's surface.
We're given that the gravitational force is F equals g times capital M times lowercase m divided by r squared, where m is the mass of the Earth, lowercase m is the mass of the satellite, r is the distance between the satellite and the center of the earth, and g is the gravitational constant.
We're also given numbers for the radius of the Earth, the mass of the Earth, and the gravitational constant.
This problem is different from the problem of lifting the calculus book.
When we lifted a book over just a few meters, the force of gravity was essentially constant over such a small distance.
So we could use the equation work equals force times distance.
But in this problem, since we're moving the satellite a larger distance, the force of gravity changes with distance.
And so we need to use work as the integral of this force with respect to distance.
The distance variable in this problem is R.
So I'll rewrite this using the equation for force and integrate with respect to Dr.

I'm starting at the Earth's surface.
So that's a distance of 6.
4 times 10 to the six meters from the center of the earth, since that's the earth radius.
And I'm ending at a height
