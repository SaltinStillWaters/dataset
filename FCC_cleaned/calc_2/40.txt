Representing Functions with Power Series.
over x divided by one of our x.
This is indeed a zero over zero indeterminate form.
So we can use lobi tiles rule and take the derivative of the top and the bottom.
The derivative of the top is one over one plus one over x times the derivative of the inside, which would be negative one over x squared.
And the derivative on the bottom, the derivative one over x is negative one over x squared, we can actually cancel out these two factors, and rewrite our limit as the limit as x goes to infinity of one over one plus one over x, which is just equal to one since one over x is going to zero.
So we found that the limit of ln y is equal to one, but we're really interested in finding the limit of y which we can think of as e to the ln y.
Since ln y is going to one, e to the ln y must be going to e to the one.
In other words, E.
So we found that our original limit is equal to E.
And in fact, you may recognize that this limit is one of the ways of defining E.
So our limit has an independent permanent form, it's hard to tell whether the answer is going to be one infinity, or maybe something in between.
Whenever I see an expression with a variable in the base, and a variable in the exponent, I'm tempted to use logarithms.
If we set y equal to one plus one over x to the x, then if I take the natural log of both sides, I can use my log roles to rewrite that by multiplying by x in the front.
Now, if I wanted to take the limit as x goes to infinity of ln y, that would be the limit of this product, x times ln one plus one over x.
As x goes to infinity, the first factor x goes to infinity.
One plus one over x goes to just one and ln one is going to zero.
So we have infinity times zero indeterminate form, which we can try to rewrite as an infinity over infinity, or a zero over zero indeterminate form.
Let's rewrite this as the limit of ln one plus one over x divided by one of our x.
This is indeed a zero over zero indeterminate form.
So we can use lobi tiles rule and take the derivative of the top and the bottom.
The derivative of the top is one over one plus one over x times the derivative of the inside, which would be negative one over x squared.

In the previous example, we had a one to the infinity and determinant form.
And we took logs and used log rules to write that as an infinity times zero indeterminate form.
Well, the same thing can be done if we have an infinity to the zero indeterminate form, or a zero to the zero and determinant form.
So one to the infinity, infinity to the zero, and zero to the zero are all indeterminate forms that can be handled using lobi TAs role.
In this video, we saw that a zero times infinity indeterminate form could be converted to a zero over zero, or infinity over infinity indeterminate form by rewriting f of x times g of x as f of x divided by one over g of x, or as g of x divided by one over f of x.
We also saw how to use lopi talls rule on these three sorts of indeterminate forms by taking the ln of y, where y is our f of x to the g of x that we want to take the limit of this video gives some tricks for deciding whether a sequence converges.
We say that a sequence a sub n converges, if the limit as n goes to infinity of the terms, a sub n exists as a finite number.
Otherwise, we say the sequence diverges.
In other words, a sequence diverges if the limit is infinity, or negative infinity, or does not exist.
More formally, we said the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n equals L, if for any small number epsilon, there's a number capital N, such that when the index little n is bigger than or equal to capital N, a sub n is within distance epsilon of owl.
Saying that a sedan is within distance epsilon of L is the same thing as saying that the absolute value of a sub n minus L is less than epsilon.
Let me draw this as a picture.
If we put in on the x axis and a sub n on the y axis, we can plot our terms a sub n like this, here, it looks like our a sub n are settling at a particular value, I'll draw the value on the y axis and call it L.
We say that the limit of a sub n is equal to L.
Because for any tiny number epsilon, here, I've tried to draw a distance epsilon above L and a distance epsilon below, we can trap or a sub ends within epsilon of L by requiring the index and to be big enough, for the epsilon I've chosen here, are a sub ends are trapped within epsilon of L, when little n is bigger than equal to three.
So there is that big number n, which is here, like two or three, such that when little n is bigger than that the a sub n are always trapped within epsilon of L.
And if I chosen a tinier epsilon, I would just have to go a little bit farther out to make sure that my sequence was trapped within epsilon of n about this is the epsilon definition of a limit.
Formally, we say the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n is infinity.
If for any big number, omega, there's a number capital N, such that a sub n is bigger than capital N, for a little n bigger than or equal to capital N.
In other words, no matter how big an Omega I originally pick, my terms a sub n are eventually true.
Above omega.
Let me draw a picture for this one too.
My terms here again, are drawn in red.
And now if I pick a certain height omega, eventually all my turns will be above omega.
And if I pick a different, bigger value of omega, my terms will still eventually be bigger than omega, I might just need to go further out in my sequence.
In the previous example, we had a one to the infinity and determinant form.
And we took logs and used log rules to write that as an infinity times zero indeterminate form.
Well, the same thing can be done if we have an infinity to the zero indeterminate form, or a zero to the zero and determinant form.
So one to the infinity, infinity to the zero, and zero
