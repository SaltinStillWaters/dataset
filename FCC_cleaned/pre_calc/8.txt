Angles and Their Measures.
how to convert between them.
angles are commonly measured using either degrees or radians.
If we're talking about degrees, then a full circle, by convention is 360 degrees.
A half circle then would be 180 degrees.
And if I wanted to do say, a third of a circle, that would be a third of 360 degrees or 120 degrees.
If we're using radians instead, then going all the way around the circle is called two pi radians.
The two pi was chosen because that's the circumference of a circle with a radius of one, a half circle is then half of two pi radians, which is pi radians.
And if I wanted to do say, a quarter of a circle, that would be a quarter of my two pi radians, a quarter of two pi is pi over two.
To convert between degrees and radians is handed to us the fact that 180 degrees corresponds to pi radians.
Both of these represent half of a circle.
Let's convert negative 135 degrees to radians.
Now, you might be wondering, what does a negative angle even mean?
Well, by convention, if we go in the counterclockwise direction, that's considered a positive angle.
And if we go in the clockwise direction, that's considered a negative angle.
To convert negative 135 degrees to radians, I could multiply by pi radians per 180 degrees.
Notice that the degrees cancel here, and I end up with negative 135 pi over 180 radians.
That simplifies to negative three Pi over four radians.
Or if I convert pi to a decimal, that's negative 2.
3562 radians, up to four decimal places.
But usually, if the answer is a simple fraction times pi, it's better to leave it in that form.
Rather than convert it to a decimal.
I can also go the other direction and convert radians to degrees, five pi over four radians.
Now again, I we need to use the fact that pi radians is 180 degrees.
But if I write it like this, with radians on the top and degrees on the bottom, then the radians won't cancel.
So that doesn't work.
Instead, so instead, I need to find by the 180 degrees over hi radians, so they got cancel the radians that way left radio cancel, and I get five pi times 180 over four pi degrees.
Now the PI's also cancel, and this simplifies to 225 degrees.
Converting seven radians to degrees is similar, I need to multiply by 180 degrees over pi radians.
If I work out seven times 180 over pi on my calculator, I get 401 point O seven degrees up to two decimal places.
Notice that my answer a little more than 400 is more than 360 degrees, so this is more than a full circle.
That makes sense since seven radians is more than two pi radians.
Since pi is itself a little more than three.
Sometimes angles are given in terms of degrees, minutes and seconds, as in 32 degrees, 17 minutes, and 25 seconds.
A minute is defined as 1/60 of a degree.
A second is defined as 1/60 of a minute, but since a minute is itself 1/60 of a degree This is 1/60 of 1/60 of a degree, or one over 3600 of a degree.
You can also think of this by saying that they're 60 minutes in one degree and they're 3600 seconds in one degree.
Let's convert this number of degrees minutes and seconds to a decimal number of degrees.
We know that we have 32 degrees plus 17 minutes plus 25 seconds.
I'm going to copy down the 32 degrees, but I need to convert the minutes to degrees.
I know that there's 60 minutes in one degree If I want the unit's to cancel, I better put the degrees on the top, so one degree corresponds to 60 minutes.
Similarly, if I want to convert seconds to degrees 25 seconds, I know that there are 3600 seconds in one degree, I want the degrees to end up on the top, and I want the seconds on the bottom to cancel with a 25 seconds.
So I need to write it this way.
Okay, now I can write this as 32 degrees plus 17 over 60 degrees plus 25 over 3600 degrees.
And because the minutes cancelled, and the seconds cancelled, if I add this all up on my calculator, I get 32.
2903 degrees up to four decimal places, I can also go the other direction, and convert a decimal number of degrees into degrees, minutes and seconds.
I'm starting out with 247 degrees plus a decimal number of degrees leftover.
If I want to convert 0.
3486 degrees, two minutes, well, I know that I have 60 minutes in one degree, this time, I want the minutes on the top and the degrees on the bottom, so that my degrees will cancel.
So I just multiply my decimal by 60.
And I end up with 20.
916 minutes.
Let me copy this down.
And now I'm going to take the 0.
916 minutes and convert those two seconds.
So I know that they're 60 seconds in one minute.
So canceling my units again, I just multiply by 60, which gives me 54.
96 minutes, I can copy this down as is.
Or I can round off my seconds and get 247 degrees, 20 minutes, and 55 seconds.
converting between different ways of measuring angles is all about unit conversion.
To convert between radians and degrees, we use the fact that pi radians corresponds to 180 degrees.
To convert between minutes and seconds and degrees, we use the fact that 60 minutes corresponds to one degree, and 60 seconds corresponds to one minute.
