[Corequisite] Combining Logs and Exponents.
so we can replace F of four with the number seven.
Now we need to evaluate g of seven, seven becomes our new x value in our table of values for G, the x value of seven corresponds to the G of X value of 10.
So g of seven is equal to 10.
We found that g composed with F of four is equal to 10.
If instead we want to find f composed with g of four, well, we can rewrite that is f of g of four, and again, work from the inside out.
Now we're trying to find g of four, so four is our x value.
And we use our table of values for G to see that g of four is one.
So we replaced by a four by one, and now we need to evaluate f of one.
Using our table for F values, f of one is eight.
Notice that when we've computed g of f of four, we got a different answer there when we computed F of G, F four.
And in general, g composed with F is not the same thing as f composed with g.
So its input would be time in years, since a certain date, as output would be number of people in the population.
The second function g, might compute health care costs as a function of population size.
So it will take population size as input, and its output will be healthcare costs.
If you put these functions together, that is compose them, then you'll go all the way from time in years to healthcare costs.
This is your composition, g composed with F.
The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle, f of x is defined as follows.
g composed with f of x is G evaluated on f of x, we can think of it schematically and so diagram, f acts on a number x and produces a number f of x, then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number, g of f of x.
Our composition of functions g composed with F is the function that goes all the way from X to g of f of x.
Let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values.
If we want to find g composed with F of four, by definition, this means g of f of four.
To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside out.
So we start with the x value of four, and we find f of four using the table of values for f of x.
When x equals four, f of x is seven, so we can replace F of four with the number seven.
Now we need to evaluate g of seven, seven becomes our new x value in our table of values for G, the x value of seven corresponds to the G of X value of 10.
So g of seven is equal to 10.
We found that g composed with F of four is equal to 10.
If instead we want to find f composed with g of four, well, we can rewrite that is f of g of four, and again, work from the inside out.
Now we're trying to find g of four, so four is our x value.
And we use our table of values for G to see that g of four is one.
So we replaced by a four by one, and now we need to evaluate f of one.
Using our table for F values, f of one is eight.
Notice that when we've computed g of f of four, we got a different answer there when we computed F of G, F four.
And in general, g composed with F is not the same thing as f composed with g.
Please Please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two examples.
We can replace f composed with F of two by the equivalent expression, f of f of two.
Working from the inside out, we know that f of two is three, and f of three is six.
If we want to find f composed with g of six, rewrite that as f of g of six isn't the table for g, g of six is eight.
But F
