Power Rule and Other Rules for Derivatives.
limit was just zero.
So my limit on the left is equal to zero.
And now I'm so close, I'd like to apply five the limit rule to this difference to break it up into a difference of limits, but I can't quite do that, because I'm not sure yet that the limit, as x goes to a of f of x exists, that's sort of part of what I'm trying to prove as far as continuity.
So instead, I think I'm gonna add to both sides, a limit that I do know exists.
And that's the limit And now I'm so close, I'd like to apply five the limit rule to this difference to break it up into a difference of limits, but I can't quite do that, because I'm not sure yet that the limit, as x goes to a of f of x exists, that's sort of part of what I'm trying to prove as far as continuity.

And that's the limit of f of a.
of f of a.
Now, I do know that both of these two limits on the left side exists, so I can use the limit rule about sums to rewrite this limit.
Now, I do know that both of these two limits on the left side exists, so I can use the limit rule about sums to rewrite this limit.
Now, on the left side, I can cancel out my copies of f of a, whatever number that is, and I get that the limit as x goes to a of f of x which has to exist by the the limit rule for psalms that I applied Now, on the left side, I can cancel out my copies of f of a, whatever number that is, and I get that the limit as x goes to a of f of x which has to exist by the the limit rule for psalms that I applied above.
above.
That limit their past to equal the limit as x goes to a of f of a, well, f of a is just some number, doesn't matter what X is doing f of a is it's just f of a, whatever that is.
So this limit on the right is just f of a, and look at that.
That's exactly what it means for a function to be continuous at x equals a, the limit as x goes to a of f of x equals f of a.
So f is continuous at x equals a, hella proof is complete.
In this video, we prove that if f is differentiable at x equals a, then f is continuous at x equals a.
This statement is equivalent to another statement known in logic as its contrapositive, which says that if f is not continuous, at x equals a, then f is not differentiable at x equals a.
In this video, we'll learn a few rules for calculating derivatives, namely, the power role, and the derivatives of sums, differences and constant multiples.
These rules will give us shortcuts for finding derivatives quickly, without needing to resort to the old limit definition of derivative.
In this video, we'll only do statements of the rules and some examples, there won't be any proofs or justification for why the rules hold.
Instead, these proofs will be in a separate later video.
Let's start with some basics.
First of all, if we have a constant C, and we will have the function f of x equals C.
So if I graph that, it's just going to be a straight horizontal line.

So the derivative So the derivative df dx, ought to be zero, because the slope of the tangent line of this straight line
